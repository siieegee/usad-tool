My husband was so excited when we got this in.  He tried it out on all of our kitchen knives and he says they work very well.  It's a bit time consuming to sharpen but the stone works better than our previous sharping utensil.,Genuine
It's a nice comfy bed. The height seems ok. I wish it was a little bigger. My 8lb pooch barely fits in there. Probably will be great toy dogs or cats.,Genuine

I bought this for my niece which is 11 months old. She loves this and plays with it all the time. It is sturdy as I was worried it would tip over with her just learning to walk. There has been no problems yet. She has had no problems getting on and off and uses it to push and walk also.,Genuine
High quality umbrella with the greatest UNCONQUERED team on it. I bought this right before the Noles' most recent BCS Championship winning season so I'm tempted to get another one again.,Genuine

Back and better than ever!!! I had both Shrinky Dinks and TMNT Toys as a kid and it's so cool that everything is back for the new generation. What's even better now is that the plastic is pre-cut so there's no sharp plastic edges like before. It's little things like that which make a big difference.,Genuine

Good product but Ive purchased over a dozen of similar led solar lights and they only seem to last approximately one year. Nice while they last but price needs to be reduced for such a short shelf life.,Genuine

A fun, light read that you'll get through quickly.",Genuine

"For the price, this is a good deal. It's a very small box. Probably the size of a mini puzzle box. Definitely not worth the 16.00 it's listed for right now. I paid $8.00 for it and that's a decent price.",Genuine
"Too big on me but the boy short style is great under your slacks or pants. Smooth, no panty lines. The fabric is really thin but rather opaque. Colors are good--flesh, nude, taupe, black. A good set.",Genuine
"I have been purchasing several of these units for local customers who are retrofitting the PAR30 can lights. It is easy to install and works great with dimmer. The price is a plus too, since most kits a Home Depot or Lowe's are about $10-$20 more.",Genuine

"I am really beginning to fall in love with this series. I love all the mystery and action, I just wish there was more to the relationships between characters. I want to feel a connection with Rachel, or Ivy, or any of the characters. There just isn't enough emotion from any of them. I love the story",Genuine
Wasn't well constructed so my dog was able to eat it in one day. It did fit perfectly inside his crate but I am very disappointed that it didn't hold up to any chewing. He has toys that have lasted over 4 months so this just wasn't very durable.,Genuine

I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creat,Genuine
We went with a different set up but we are keeping these as we could use this in our kids play house. It's longer then we hoped for and a difficult application but if you need a universal bracket for the ceiling or end of window mounting this will work.,Genuine

I used it with the IPOD classic pictured in the icon.",Genuine

These are great!  Especially for docking or using to keep two boats together in open water.  Very nice looking and seem well made.,Genuine

I had a little trouble with the top being a little too high.  It hits the shelf above the rod so the divider does not move freely.",Genuine
Wasn't sure what'd I'd find behind the old Aprilaire thermostat I was removing so I purchased this. I'd totally recommend this even if you're not needing to cover issues. It makes it look way nicer.,Genuine
"I really enjoyed this story, the back and forth telling of the two sisters was great. I hated for it to end. Thank you for a another great read.",Genuine

This was a most enjoyable read. The relationship between the two main characters was fascinating as were their personal histories.  I'd like to see this book as required reading in high schools.,Genuine
I was hoping for something a little more tabloidish. I'm glad I got to read it for free (Prime member) because I would have been mad if I had paid to read this one.,Genuine
Not at all satisfied with this DVD.  Especially the sound.  Just not at all clear and fades out in some scenes. Picture not the best in fact I have seen better.  Don't recommend this unless you are a collector.  Better DVDs out there.,Genuine
Thought since it was made of tough stuff that it would last awhile.  I hope the body lasts because the feet were chewed off within 5 minutes.  We have a black lab that is not a chewer.,Genuine

"I really wanted to love these IEMs, but I can't.

I was immediately impressed by the packaging. These buds came in the neatest, most functional little white box, kind of like the EarPod cases that double as carrying cases. But the EQ on these are awful. They're marketed as bass-heavy IEMs but that m",Genuine
