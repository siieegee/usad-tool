"OR";"For the untrained Clive Barker reader, Abarat will seem like a vivid dream, an elaborate creation, a thing of wonder and beauty to be praised and revered. To the serious Clive Barker reader, it amounts to the PG-13 version of Weaveworld and imajica combined. Clive has taken to the all-ages genre and"

"OR";"Where's a Zero rating when you need one?
This is just ... a mess. Overrun with mean-spiritedness, the vileness of the anti-female ramblings is matched only by the sub-amateur production values.

"OR";"This series is amazing! Even if it only has a handful of episodes, it's so well-plotted and most of the characters are amazingly acted.

"OR";"I gave this 4 stars because it seems like a good story.  The problem was that it just isn't the kind of story I am interested in.  I made it about half way through but just couldn't go on. I am sure others will enjoy it."
"OR";"I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.

"OR";"I enjoyed the book enough to finish it. I have to say though that I thought the mystery wasn't a mystery to me at all. I won't ruin the surprise just that I figured it out long before it came out in the story. I do love the way Lee Childs writes his stories and the Jack Reacher character.

"OR";"Aren't literary heroes supposed to teach us something? Aren't they supposed to inspire us? How someone like Skye could be the main character?

"OR";"I bought this in blue as well. It fits well and has good weight without being overpowering or too clingy. I did buy it in small and I usually take an 8 but because it was very full, I thought the small would fit fine. It does."
"OR";"Anyone who loves the Minions, will love this theme based play set.  Cute little figures.  Comes with its own case.  Not recommended for smaller kids based on the size of the characters"

"OR";"Very delightful book to read. I looked for other books by this author and didn't find any. That was disappointing. Can't wait to read more books by this author. This book will keep you entertained from beginning to the end."
"OR";"Not a five because it was so short  but really well written and interesting. I kept reading this book was based on a real life event and am familiar with that tragedy, but I did not feel any great connection. The book  stands on its own."

"OR";"My dog loves this bed, it is his absolute favorite! He loved it so much I have bought three.  I love it too, because it holds up well in the wash. It is a very soft, and the perfect size, with room to spare for my 10 pound miniature schnauzer."
"OR";"Great all in one CLP.  I use it all the time and it works very well.  Safe for use and smells great.  No more toxic fumes and chemicals to clean.  You will see a difference in cleaning time as you repeat clean."

"OR";"So far so good. Easy to install. It does feel kinda light and cheap, but it has a warranty to make up for it in case it breaks.

UPDATE: over a year in use, it hasn't broke and still works great!"
"OR";"I'm not an audiophile. My golden ears from yesteryear have tarnished rather badly.  I wanted a no-frills subwoofer to balance out my good-but-small bookshelf speakers.

"OR";"I should have read the description because this was way smaller than I had pictured it in my mind... which is not anything wrong with the product! It's actually really cute and a better size for baby hands than a bigger one would have been."
"OR";"I liked the books storyline and the couple very much.  Monique and Oliver were very likable and I really liked them being together.  I did not like his friend Felicity and how he kept her around.  They were great when they were together."
"OR";"Great movie... years ago I bought the DVD of these movies, they had 5.1 sound. I bought this for the 1080p quality but these are only 2 channel... What happened...? I would not buy this if you are like me and want the HD experience..."

"OR";"I loved my first pair so much, I got another.  I'm short-waisted, so it's wonderful to find pants that don't come up to my ribs, or have a zipper that's ludicrously too long.  These are great."
"OR";"I bought this for my dog (Border Collie mix) and she loves it.  It's very comfortable and she can really relax.  I would HIGHLY Recommend this bed.  It's easy to assemble and sturdy.  I also bought a replacement cover as well."

"OR";"Good read. Enjoyed the story, Forbes is a good story teller. This book was true to the tone of the previous books. If was a fast read, that provided some escape from the day to day load."
"OR";"This story was great. Once you start reading you can't put it down. Great friendships, laughter, love and awful families. Interesting use of a cell phone. Standalone, but it's a great series."
"OR";"Great product -- well made -- easy to adjust and easy to put on -- I have a three year old, 90 lb Golden Ret and it works well (XL) -- Recpmmend"
"OR";"It works great and was extremely cheap. It is just the size that I wanted and got here quickly.  Great for corn or any kind of muffin.  Also good for cupcakes.  My daughter likes it too."

"OR";"This series was a fun read. Yes a somewhat predictable ending, but the characters were interesting and real. These are a good rainy day read that leaves you with hope for the characters and looking forward to the next book."
"OR";"My dogs always destroy their toys but this one always lasts much longer than the rest( have bought this one multiple times). And its huge for the price!! My dogs seem to think the bigger the toy the better."
"OR";"Im in love w my new vest. Im very small and it still fits well. I wish i could make itnjust a little smaller but otherwise its perfect"
"OR";"I have loved every book in the Longmire series.  (The TV show is good, but not as good as the books.)  A Serpent's Tooth keeps up the somewhat otherworldly direction in which Longmire seems to be heading , but no so much that it obscures the story."
"OR";"Great love story. Wonderful how a bad thing turn awesome. This is a great series and it was hard to put down. Could not wait to see the outcome. This is my favorite author."
"OR";"First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal "
"OR";"""First Blood"" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time. I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama. Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of othe"
"OR";"Best read ever! Can't wait til the next one is out. Laugh my but off on certain places. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Keep up the good work ladies and keep them coming."
"OR";"Typically this author has a better end product.  Book wanders all over creation doesn't blend the individual stories of the primary characters very well - disappointing read waste of time"
"OR";"There are several facets to this love story.  Well written and pulled me along. It's always interesting to see how people can muck up their lives in the name of love and in some cases lust. Worth reading."
"OR";"Love love love these hooks. They are perfect for any garage that you want to keep organized and neat. I not only hang our bikes from them also the ladders that are in the way and my folded up strollers. Such a great product for a cheap price."
"OR";"I really enjoyed reading this book.  The story line different enough that I regretted putting my reader away every time.  Harrison is an excellent writer and author.  I will read book 2 soon."
"OR";"It's taking my son longer to get through this latest release...hmmm... Could the relationship be over? He says it's still a good book but I think he's aged out. The set will be nice for his children someday."
"OR";"A little on the small size but as to be expected since it says that it is fitting... its also pretty thin and feels more like costume material which for some reason I didn't expect.. still cute, it'll work!"
"OR";"I gotta say this one actually looks like Johnny Depp a lot and its really well done. It even has the scares on the face! Great detail equals a great buy."
"OR";"Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas since he said he needed a pan big enough to cook fish in.  We use it frequently for swai, and it comes pre-seasoned, which is nice as well!  A great product!"

"OR";"I love this bag! It's large, long, and sturdy! The zipper is great as well, as most similar bags don't have one. Also, the color / pattern variation is random, I know, but I got just what I had hoped for!"

"OR";"I thought this would be just the older versions of the fairy tales we all know and love but I found that this book has more then 150 stories in it.  It is enjoyable to read and I love finding more older stories that we don't hear anymore."
"OR";"Watched this on Amazon streaming and enjoyed watching it. Not a movie that I would buy (I usually only buy movies I ""love""), but it was worth the rental fee. It had an Interesting story, I would recommend watching it."
"OR";"I have a chihuahua and I bought the medium and my dog LOVES this. I added another little blanket in it for extra padding like she likes. And she doesn't leave this high seat. I would recommend this highly."

"OR";"Good one time read. The heroine does get verbally trashed a lot by the hero so that was a bit irksome. Looking forward to reading Sera's story."
"OR";"I have never read anything about this author before, and I have to say that I was delighted with his work. I enjoyed this novel a lot, and it gave me a good glimpse of what life can be for a well-off older couple in modern Israel. How they cope with everyday life, family issues, death, mourning, sep"
"OR";"Large is bigger than expected, but my MinPins love em and although small dogs, they are very hard on toys. Had the smaller ones when they were puppies, and these are great for them as adult dogs."

"OR";"I had ordered these to store my sewing patterns in, but realized too late that the inner dimensions are much smaller than the outer dimensions as pointed out in another review here, so my patterns wouldn't fit at all. Instead I ended up using them to store small scraps of cotton fabrics separated by"
"OR";"This book was different I was not expecting it to be about an author who has a stalker.  The stalker was very cruel and just a bad person. A killer as well.

"OR";"Great cardigan. I am 5'4, 157lb and a 36B- I got a large and this fit me perfect. I've tried it on with short and long maxi dress and looks great with both. Nice material that I think will be long lasting."
"OR";"This is a perfect example of CGI taking over.  It's obvious someone drew up a storyboard with a dozen action scenes and another dozen tense lines.  There may have been vague intentions to add in credible plot details and character motivations before the actors arrived.  Time apparently ran out.  Thi"

"OR";"Love, Lucy was a great book that I read along with my friends. There is travel, romance, college life, and self-discovery. I liked seeing Italy through Lucy's eyes and falling in ""something"" with Jesse Palladino. He definitely is crush-worthy.

"OR";"my one year old cat loves this. As soon as it was put together, he went in and didn't come out for hours. And uses everyday.

"OR";"These are the best pans that I have EVER had in my life. I absolutely ""love"" them. I have never had anything stick to them and they are really made heavy. I would highly recommend buying them. Great product."
"OR";"Sadly, I have tried this model again (for the 2nd time) and it still proved problematic for me. As for playing content, I agree it plays a vast number of differing file formats.

"OR";"I've always enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Ghostwalkers, that being said I've fallen in love with the Shadow Riders. This series promises to be a refreshing new world full of sexy alpha anti-heroes, strong women and an amazing cast of secondary characters.

Stefano Ferraro is a ruthless alpha who is in charge"
"OR";"It's a good message, and the illustrations are really captivating, but the story is very didactic. The message is very clearly ""be yourself"", and it hits you over the head with that. The illustrations are fun to look at. If it weren't for the heavy-handedness of the message it would be a really good"
"OR";"Very good quality for the price. they run a bit small so if you like your shirts loose I'd order a size larger. In fact that's the only reason they don't get five stars."
"OR";"It's got enough story line to make it interesting, the special effects carry the story MOST of the time (without seeming gratuitous), and the stars are good to look at, what's not to like?"
"OR";"I have three of these in various sizes for my two children (currently 1yo and 3yo).  We almost never go to the beach or water park without these. Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wet"
"OR";"This book is book two and a good one in the Billionaire Boys Club series.  It is very refreshing in the fact that the lead guy isn't classical gorgeous, but is attractive by what is inside.  Loved it and love this series!"
"OR";"I really loved the tote, well made, a fashion trend. I wanted to keep it, however, I am a small person and it was just too big and overwhelming for my body size. However, I will order other items."
"OR";"This book, if possible, is even better than the first book, The Passage.  I love the twists and turns and I can't put it down.  Can't wait to see what happens in the last book of this trilogy."
"OR";"An exciting read to be sure.  Felix's writing is becoming more like his father's with every book.  I didn't know who ""done"" it until the very end.  It's better that way!

Keep up the good writing, Felix!"
"OR";"This is fun.  I use to watch these kind of movies when I was a child.  This was good to see.  I enjoyed the concept of Hercules in this one.  Could be what really happened.  Check it out and see what you think."
"OR";"I'm a huge fan of the Saucony Jazz sneaker. They're not the most durable, nor are they particularly good for exercise or whatever. They're comfortable, though, and will serve as a basic fitness shoe. Moreover, they are fashionable. They always look classy, and this is a style that I don't think will"
"OR";"I was intrigued and so bought this book, only then I realised how interesting the book and the subject was. It's a tough read stepping in a mentally ill mind but interesting to see the way they think. Good read, very informative."
"OR";"The World's End is a well-written action, middle-age life crisis, dark humored meets sci-fi film. The actors bring characters to life, making them believable. Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed"
"OR";"the quality id good, price is right and they can come right to your door,so you don't have to drive all over town looking for them-kids love them and they can take what kids dish out in play time"
"OR";"Great story line & characters.  The New Orleans setting was perfect & fun.  Kept me turning the pages, yet not wanting the story to end! Will look for more from this author!"
"OR";"I read this book for the first time in the late 90s. It was if it were brand new to me.  And, like any good book, I didn't want to put it down. Great and enjoyable way to re familiarize yourself with the characters before reading any of  Jan Karon's books that follow."
"OR";"The entire series is great! The stories continue from one book to the next, picking up where one left off. I am definitely looking forward to reading more Julie Johnstone books!"
"OR";"I read very little fiction but as an older friend said it is a ""pot boiler.""None stop action,well written,and one that is hard to put down. I have actually read it three or four times."
"OR";"Vivian Rose Lee has done it again.  This book will keep you captive from start to finish. This book is a story that you can envision happen in real life. The love in the story will win your heart. Great story great book."
"OR";"I buy these books for my husband each year.  He is not an enthusiastic reader of novels, but he loves trivia, so he is thrilled with this book.  I highly recommend it for the person on your list who is hard to shop for... who can resist learning a bit of trivia?"

"OR";"LOVE THIS SHOE RACK!  After several purchases. .. this one holds up! Tall. Sturdy.  Plenty of room for 50 pairs of shoes. Love. Love. Love it! Buy here! Buy this!"
"OR";"Arrived really quick. Easy to install, and although I would like it to squirt a little more soap with one push, it does work well. Much cheaper price than in the stores."
"OR";"I really love these flip flops, most comfortable ones ever!  The texture on the sole of your foot feels good, and is ""dryer"" than some other flip flops/ other materials/ that is, less slippery if wet.  I probably didn't explain that well  but you know what I mean, I hope.  The shoes are attractive, "

Dauntless. Amity. Erited. And one more which name I can't remember. Beatrice's test results are divergent. This is"
"OR";"I love these TV trays. They look nice and seem built well. I couldn't be happier. I did see other reviews with brown pictures. I did not experience this with mine. I think this was a good buy and I would buy it again."
"OR";"This helmet is absolutely fantastic. It comes in sizes. It has good adjustments for the internal cage AND for the chin straps. You can adjust both the length of the chin strap portion AND adjust the triangle portion about the ears separately. You can put the usual foam pads inside as well for final "
"OR";"I love the watch. It is bright and cheery and easy to read. I don't know if I will wear it this summer because the plastic is a bit sweaty on warm and humid days. It's a great casual watch."
"OR";"This book is fantastic.  It uses the best training approach, very effective.  It takes a ""dog whisperer"" style of understanding dogs and treating them with respect, understanding that the real key to dog training is to train YOU how to teach your dog.  The book is full of not only very specific and "
"OR";"MotoSolutions FogTech Anti-Fog is the best stuff I have ever used to keep my glasses from fogging up when I am hunting or working! It is great to find a product that works this well.  I am really impressed!  Thanks, TimJ"
"OR";"I bought this based on the high reviews and they were right! This was SO soft! It's held up in washes.  I've never seen quality like this at this price. Ordered this for my daughter and will order more for the rest of us."
"OR";"This is a great product.  So much better than those clear plastic ones. My dog seems a lot happier with this one.  She doesn't bump and scrape against things nearly as much."
"OR";"This book of Narcissism can really help people to avoid being self-centered. It is accesible and easy to read. I have a friend who have a narcissistic personality. This book really gives you all the information you need."
"OR";"For us men with big fingers, hitting the keys on the tiny keypad on my iPhone is a huge challenge.  Also, I'm 56 and never learned to ""thumb type"".  Every time I type something, there's a mistake, and then a bizarre autocorrect, that can cause a LOT of embarrassment.  Yikes.

This keyboard is flawle"
"OR";"Gumby how could u go wrong . My sisters dog loves this ..and its still whole I'm amazed . She loves this and carries it in her mouth like a baby so precious. I would buy this again."
"OR";"My toddler loves Elmo and therefore this book is very effective in getting her to use the potty to ""be like Elmo"". The story line is a little complex for a 21 month old but she loves lifting all the flaps. Very happy with this book."
"OR";"*** 3.5 stars ***

 I don't know how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong it was good - what I read of it anyway. I had to stop reading because for some unknown reason it made me sad. I knew something bad was going to happen. The sense of foreboding was overwhelming and I just couldn't take it"
"OR";"Krista Lakes has done it yet again in Freshwater Kisses.  This book, like her other books in this series are sweet, romantic, and down right great.  If you are looking for a very well-written down to earth romance story you have found it.  These books are great!!!!"
"OR";"I gave this as a gift to someone who likes turtles and LOVES cooking. She tells me they are perfect and really cute. So that works for me too! Actually they look even better in person than in the picture."
"OR";"I really like this towel but make sure you know what size you actually need. If I ordered again I would've purchased a large so it would fit around my entire waist. Have taken it traveling and camping and it's great for both"
"OR";"Another great book by Ms Miller.  This was a different setting for this story, not being in cowboy country but she did really well in San Francisco and Portland.  Really wish this was just the first of a series."
"OR";"Just finished this story.  A little long on the details but I wouldn't have missed it for anything.  Always a great story line by Andrew Peterson and The Nathan McBride Series - well - keep them coming!!!!"
"OR";"After 5 novels hasn't Mr. Moody learned that you just, can't, put, a comma, wherever you want to? And at times, well, a comma is needed. This could be credited to extreme sloppiness and mistakes that editors should notice right away. Like the fact that California is 9, not 8 hours behind Amsterdam. "
"OR";"The barrel nut remover tool is a must if you are going to add a Breacher or muzzle break to your KSG. I found the HI-Tech to be very well made and a great value. Follow the instructions and it works very well."
"OR";"These have held up well to repeated use for water storage/transport in packs. They are a bit stiff, but do roll up well. I have no complaints other than I would like to have more and wish they were less expensive. A good product I would recommend."
"OR";"this was a great product at a really good price.  Easy to install.  Gives the cabinets a feel of higher quality than it did with the old rollers.  holds the cabinet closed very well."
"OR";"Well made with quality material. My daughter loves it! Im so glad to finally found a ""coronation day"" dress my daughter has been asking for. It fit perfect and shipping was quick!"
"OR";"High school requirement for granddaughter.  She came home and said she needed this book.  We received it in great shape and in a good turn around time.  Haven't read the book so I can't critique it."

"OR";"I am writing this for my two dogs. They say they really like them and want me to purchase more in future. They also like the fact that there is little chance that the chews will get stuck in their throats.

Is there anything else.........I guess not."
"OR";"Bought this as a gift for a friend's daughter. Came in a box and looks to be of good quality. I like toys like this that are a project for kids and become a keepsake as well."
"OR";"They're exactly as shown, but for some reason I had expected them to look better. I don't know. They're nice enough. I like them, but I'm not in love with them or anything. They fit as expected."
"OR";"These things are wonderful! Love them and when I ordered this time around it looks like they received a nice upgrade. Cant beat the warranty either. I recommend this to everyone and will continue to use their products."
"OR";"Wow this is a scorching hot short story, and so true how many times have I talked to others in the book club about this kind of stuff. Amazing can't wait to read the next book."
"OR";"I got my backpack, tried to put my 5lb chihuahua in it and it doesn't look anything like the pictures on the page. The sizes aren't accurate.  I wasn't able to tighten the hole small enough so that my dog wouldn't fall out. I did not feel like my dog was safe in this carrier. Also, the first time I "
"OR";"I August turn his life around and Brianna need to chill . I'm loving these new characters in the mix of the book. Your books are great and I can't stop reading so now I'm waiting on part 3 !!!!"
"OR";"I love this thing. It is super cute. The babies (16M old) can't quite push it down hard enough to make him go but they love to watch it go when I do it and they roll it around."
"OR";"My husband adores these. They are very well made and fit him perfectly. He likes to keep his feet warm?  I have no regrets on purchasing these or paying the price they asked. To me it  was worth it. I would buy again from this seller."
"OR";"Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind,"
"OR";"i was really looking forward to using these gloves at work. They are unravelling at the base after using them less than a month.  I probably won't buy this brand for tactical/law enforcement use in the future."
"OR";"They fit tightly and a little difficult to get on however they never fall off.  They look good and do the job well.  After they eventually wear out I will purchase the same product again.  Priced to sell also."
"OR";"Great cast of characters and a really good story line.  A real strong ending of good overcoming real evil.  Enjoyed it and i look forward to future stories."
"OR";"I enjoyed this book.  Especially the way the story was told from different viewpoints throughout the story.  There were times when the author would include lengthy sections that had little to do with the story, but otherwise it was an enjoyable mystery."
"OR";"So cute rumbles and rolls. I don't think my son liked it as much as I did.  I thought it was precious.  He liked it good enough.  will probably like it better later after new wears off other Christmas gifts."
"OR";"Fantastic plot. Well told story. Great characters played by talented actors! Good clean entertainment without a lot of hoopla. Couldn't ask for a better show."
"OR";"I am very short: 4'9"".  10 years ago, I could find pants and jeans that were short enough without more than the normal petite person's problem.  Then companies started to lengthen inseams.  I was never able to find pants in stores and only ordered online from places like lands end or llbean that are"
"OR";"I bought two. They have looked great on both my vehicles for several months. Now, I just wish people knew what it was around here.

Update: After almost a year more, they still are holding on and looking great! Go Tigers!"
"OR";"Almost as good as sex. These are simple & easy to go from one cal. to another just by changing the drum. like these. Price seems reasonable also.
Good buy."
"OR";"Love this would recommend this to anyone to buy. Easy to hod and keeps butter fresh. Like the easy clean up too. Just hand wash. Price was also very good."
"OR";"Great medium sized trash can.  Takes Simple Human bags size E.  Works well like all Simple Human products.  Looks great."
"OR";"My dogs love these and I need to buy more. I forgot and bought something else last time and my dogs wouldn't touch it. Easy way to get glucosamine into my picky 14,year old husky."
"OR";"She does it again. She has a way of writing that I felt the characters were real. We hate the mean people and love the innocent and good characters. I loved the consequences to all the characters in the story. She always has romance and tragedy woven  in her stories."
"OR";"My son loves his new shirt and can't wait to wear it for his superhero party! Good quality, I think the logo will hold up pretty well throughout washes."
"OR";"I'm so happy all worked out in the end. How many times we've heard of selling our souls for material gain, well after reading this book we should all be content with our lot in life."
"OR";"I received this book free through Story Cartel for my honest and unbiased review. THANK YOU!
This was a very good book, if you like fantasy this is for you; the characters were well written and I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
"OR";"Pretty good book. Had my attention until the end. Toward the end of the book it couldn't keep my attention and moved pretty fast. I found myself slightly confused. Will probably read book two though."
"OR";"Gave this to my 6 year old granddaughter who Loves headbands. We made them together and she loved it and was so very excited that she made her own with her own special jewels, etc... wonderful gift, will buy for gifts for other little girls!"
"OR";"I was a little skeptical when I first purchased this. I bought it to enhance an indoor area by our front door. It gives a wonderful light and is very fun to look at. I only use it during the summer and will buy another one next year."
"OR";"Based on my liking of most of writer Andrew Niccol's films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gattaca-Blu-ray/dp/B000HEVZ6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gattaca [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Truman-Show-Blu-r"
"OR";"I've read a few of the short stories based in the near future where our online lives are run by autos, smart apps designed to make our lives easier. The author creates a plausible and sinister vision of the future which I'd enjoyed. Now all of the stories have been combined into a single book, along"
"OR";"Bought these gloves for my 14 yr old daughter and she loves them.  The are very comfortable.  She plays softball pretty much year around and the CFX are the only brand we have bought that lasts over a year."
"OR";"I've always wanted running capris with mesh behind the knees. These work great. Don't ride up, comfortable waist. I think I bought them a size too small but they have lots of stretch, so it works."
"OR";"Had this when I was a kid and thought it was a lot of fun. Wanted my oldest granddaughter to have one because she really likes drawing. She loves it!  I'll probably have to buy 2 more once the other to granddaughter's are old enough."
"OR";"Great price, great quality, great customer service. I ended up not needing this product and wanted to return it, i was reimbursed in full and was told to keep the item."
"OR";"Only have had for a week, but working very well. Great for use next to bed to charge devices overnight with built in USB ports. And great price. I would recommend to other and purchase again myself."
"OR";"UPDATE: finally installed this front sight - it was much easier than i thought - found out that Ruger used red loctite, but with a good gunsmith screwdriver got the original iron sight off...

Recommended, easy to assemble, easy storage place for game pieces with in the game board
Good buy."
"OR";"I loved this story, actually I really liked all of them! Great reads, wish they could have been a bit longer. Then don't we all wish that with stories we don't want to end"
"OR";"These are really flimsy and tear easily. I will keep buying them though, because they are the only ones I can find that fit the Littermaid box. I do use them with a bag, which makes them more cost effective because you can use them more than once. Overall, they're fine for what they are."
"OR";"This is an update to my previous one star review, after several e mails I was able to receive a replacement, led lamp and power supply as per Kathy at GLW, very pleasant person.

"OR";"I absolutely love this new author. I think he has a big future in the world of fantasy. I so much enjoyed the complexity of the plot and the wonderful uniqueness of the world and characters created in all three books of The Trinity Saga I have read so far. The idea of the stone angels, Nemuri, that "
"OR";"I like these and not sure if they would fit a half size smaller so I kept them.  They seem a bit long in the front, but are very comfortable and look cute with jeans, and leggings.  Love the color."

"OR";"Lifeboat (Alfred Hitchcock, 1944)

You take a John Steinbeck story, have Jo Swerling (Pennies from Heaven) adapt it, and get Alfred Hitchcock to direct, with a cast including Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn, Henry Hull, and Walter Slezak, among others. How can you not have a hit?

"OR";"It has been hard to find good quality in the smaller size patches, until now. These are great. They fit perfect and look better than any others I've tried. I will definitely be back."
"OR";"I did order the next size larger because of the comments of others and it worked well.  They are very warm and I will never have to worry about my feet getting wet.  They are sturdy and will last me a long time."
"OR";"I purchased this for my son in Alaska.  So many places will not ship to Alaska.  My son said since he seasoned it, it has been great for taking it camping and for use at home.  I would recommend this company and this product."
"OR";"Fits better than expected! It doesn't smoosh anywhere and it's comfortable all day which is great since my job is very physical. There's no popping out of this one and it's great that it's available in odd sizes like 32G."
"OR";"Easily surfaced my new 42x60 workbench top. Large size makes for quicker job and keeps a fine edge for the whole deal. Great bit, well balanced."
"OR";"This case should work well to protect my iPad from getting bounced around on the boat (I know it's not waterproof--the iPad sits on dash at a great angle.  It is a bit heavy, but fit well."
"OR";"Great bra...suuuuuuuuuuper comfy.  good support.went online and bought another one. best bra I've had in 20 yrs highly recommend  10 star out of 5!"
"OR";"The reason we gave 4 stars is because the instructions were horrible!!!
I read them several times and couldn't understand how to work it.
I had to watch the video online but once I did I could explain it to my niece who absolutely loved it!"
"OR";"Worked fantastically. Good heavy paper makes an easy seamless background. Good color as well. It is heavy and it does want to unroll, but I read the comments here and was prepared with a clamp."
"OR";"I finally bought this after year-before-last's annual ""fight with the bird"", and am very happy I did.  This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the "
"OR";"I purchased this set as a last minute purchase- the product is good. It chages quickly and is lighter than the Nikon brand I had been using. The car charger is great. Good product for the price."
"OR";"Best keyboard cover I've had to date. Laptop keys still have a little bit of ""give"", which I like, and the material just feels nice on the fingertips. Will buy more once I'll wear this one out."
"OR";"I like this better than the finish line I was using. It has a sort of opaque or foamy look to it so you can actually see what it's doing and it hangs on to the chain pretty well. End result cleaner and less waste."
"OR";"I ordered two of these and one is a very tan color (as in the image) and one is dark brown. The inner parts are not at all finished and the quality just doesn't look very good. Spend a little more for something that will look good."
"OR";"An absolutely fascinating book, very readable. Perfect book for anyone who loves nature, my husband and I were so inspired by this book that we took a vacation to see the trees and hike some of the areas described in this book."
"OR";"This is a fairly nifty multifunction gadget for any golfer, and would make a nice inexpensive gift. As a divot repair tool this is solidly built and works OK. It also has a magnetic ball marker that slides off when you press the bottom of it (it has a 19th hole logo, which you can have replaced with"
"OR";"These work great. I bought the same in different sizes for different applications. I would buy again. If you need just a couple, make sure you measure the diameter of your cup holder or whatever, before ordering."
"OR";"It is Excellent, I received on time and the quality is great work as Its required and I will give 5 stars, its just Wonderful, better impossible, I was checking many different and similar of this one and I couldn't find someone like this."
"OR";"This is a very nice necklace - very feminine - I got it for my granddaughter's 18th birthday and she said that she loves it - is's very good quality, along with the chain - and the butterfly is very pretty - just the right size"
"OR";"This series just gets better and better. Outstanding characters, vivid descriptions, great action in every book.
Buy this series and you won't read anything else until you have caught up."
"OR";"As long as you have an idea of what size Skechers you wear, I would say that these are in the same size range. They are very cute and comfortable, which is what you would expect in a Skechers shoe. I wanted the red striped ones, but those were sold out."
"OR";"Lauren Oliver is a powerful writer whose prose punches the reader in the gut while creating empathy for the characters and building suspense. Panic does this in spades. It has a desperate, pessimistic, chilling tone that reflects the feelings of the main characters. Heather, Dodge, Natalie and Bisho"
"OR";"This was purchased as a gift for our 19 year old who has a real interest in photograph. He has fallen in love with the Nikon gem and is rarely seen without it. Easy to use - great photos as well."

"OR";"Quality is better than I expected for the price. Nice shirt. I bought ""Best Dad Ever"" for my son-in-law and ""Best Kid Ever"" in the same color for my granddaughter. They're a cute couple!"
"OR";"A good read. Learning to over come your fears is a task all it's own. And Samantha has to learn the hard way. This character is stubborn! But she's also fun. Pretty good read,would be a good weekend quicki"
"OR";"Should fiction writers use Roget's Thesaurus? I've read and heard arguments on both sides. Those who say ""No"" think that writers using It write overblown prose, using a long word where a shorter one would be better.
I disagree. There are times when the first word that comes to mind is the easy word "
"OR";"This is a great toy sturdy build and should last a long time. It is by no means a great piano but it is a really great toy. My 15 month daughter loves playing on it, sitting on it, climbing on it, and banging the keys."

"OR";"These shoes are so comfy. I wear a size 8 so that's what I ordered and they fit perfect. They also have the memory foam inside so they are very comfortable. These would be great for walking or just to exercise in . I love them ."
"OR";"I bought this for my niece. It is so cute! She loved it! It's small, so it won't take up too much space. But big enough for little hands to grab and play with it. Such a fun idea! I will be buying one for my daughter."
"OR";"I also did not have the easiest time getting this watching working and setup to a display I liked. There isn't a display more that I like. I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch "
"OR";"I bought this to use as a shoe tray for our coach but it didn't fit in the area that I wanted it for. It is very high-quality, don't hesitate if this is what you're looking for. It would also work well under a dog feeder."
"OR";"We had a similar one for my daughter, but couldn't find it and wanted to take my son in the pool! He loves it! The monster in front as well as the attached toys are great for keeping him occupied, and the top is great for shade! Love this!"
"OR";"well written story and wonderful characters...lots of medical details that were beyond me, but made so much sense as dialogue between two doctors...read her another of her books, Press 2, which was great as well"
"OR";"Excellent, well-acted, and very informative show! I have not read the book, but seeing the series makes me interested in knowing more about Adams. And Laura Linney gives Abigail a lot of depth as well."
"OR";"We have multiple iPads with different movies and TV shows on each.  With the iPad storage limitations I had to pick and choose periodically to remove and add movies.

"OR";"These are thin and flimsy but we only used the as party hats for a few hours. So for the price, they did what we expected. Just don't expect to get a lot of use or long term use out of them. They fit 2-8 year olds just fine."
"OR";"I loved this book. Aislinn is my hero. She makes me want to be a beautiful, capable, kind, (and calculating) woman.
This was my first book by Woodiwiss, and I'm hoping they're all this awesome."
"OR";"These are *much* smaller than I expected, but they also come with their own little stand to hold the sticks while they burn.  I'll say that breaks even and give them 5 stars, because they smell great (not too overpowering)."
"OR";"I'd just finished reading Orphan Train which was a fantastic book. I hurried to buy another book by Kline, but have found this one a bit dull and have now skipped to the end to read the last few pages."
"OR";"This is a set of 2 one for each side of the dog vest. They arrived on time and where exactly as described. These will work great for my daughters diabetic alert dog that is in training. They also seem to be a very good quality. I would recommend."
"OR";"I love Jim Cymbala's writings! He is so honest, broken, and sincere. Every page oozes warmth and Christ-like generosity. This book is one of his best! I will definitely read it again for inspiration and encouragement."

I tried my husbands leash like this and am much happier"
"OR";"Really enjoyed this book. It was awesome. Two people who lost and found each other. They had their troubles but could not overcome their feelings. So glad they found each other. They fit. Loved and lost but to only find love again"
"OR";"Obama most have read this book because it was very much anti-coal.  Even at that I found it a pretty good read.
It was a short book and kind of left you hanging at the end."
"OR";"Ainsley finds out more about herself. She is going to pick the next Alpha. She just doesn't know who it will be. This story is well written and has great characters. I am ready for the next book to find out what happens."

"OR";"These trains arrived promptly all in a tiny see thru plastic zip top bag. They are slightly larger than the trains that came with my Mexican train domino set, but just barely.

"OR";"I like the look of this leash and it's comfortable in my hand when I'm walking my dog, but the hook hardware is big and heavy for a small dog so I would not recommend this for dogs less than 20lbs."

"OR";"I love the looks of these boots and they are comfortable but definitely run big! I would say that the 8.5 fits more like a 9 or even 9.5.  I wish I had exchanged them for a smaller size. Sitting in my closet."
"OR";"Watch it front start to finish,, We are sure you will love this movie as much as we did. Super actress and actors ..  Plus you never find much in a good movie with comedy mix in it with love added to it.."
"OR";"Our kitties always eat it all. Tells us that it's good, I always read the ingredient list of my cats' food, I want them to have the best I can give them. Merrick provides a nice variety of foods they love."
"OR";"I can really get lost in a good ufo dvd, been watching them for years. This is high quality and makes a fine addition to my collection.  They didn't skimp on the content at all. Lots of great information."
"OR";"I got this for my daughter and she loved it. We had fun putting it together. Good quality and we had some extra leftover Lego pieces from other builds so we were able to add to this item so she now has a unique Poe Dameron!!!"
"OR";"Made of heavy gauge sturdy wire, but feels really balanced when you are using it.  I bought this because I lost the one we had before.  I like this one so much better, I wish I'd lost the other one sooner."
"OR";"Brave is a great kids movie that an adult can actually sit through.  This movie has a good story and its told well.  The animation is very good and I would recommend this movie."
"OR";"I enjoy reading and this book was really good, I didn't want it to end; great book, good read, you'll enjoy it buy it."
"OR";"Recently bought this knife because its size and shape are comfortable to do many things. The quality is very nice as well. Knowing up front, it was not made in Germany, I am happy with its cost and value. Made in Thailand."
"OR";"The fit for my P239 is perfect and it looks great. It holds the gun securely and releases when it is supposed to. This is one of the best holsters I own, especially at this price point and I will be looking to Fobus when I need another one!"
"OR";"Cute shoes! for the price is worth getting. I do not have narrow feet and the size I ordered fit me well. I always got half a size up. Long wear, depending on the activity, the shoe is comfortable."
"OR";"Dog LOVES these!  He was eating them too quickly so I purchased the ball that holds the treats.  He has been working on the ball for 3 days now and he is not nagging me to go anywhere.  I think we are all happy with this product!"
"OR";"This novela was charming! A sweet story of love, with likable characters and a great sense of humor. I laughed out loud several times. I am looking forward to reading Jen's other books!"
"OR";"great read and hard to put down....and half the time I wanted to close my eyes and hold my breathe because I couldn't read your words fast enough! and I now have to wait for next book....please, please....hurry....."
"OR";"When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had abso"
"OR";"One of the better cop partner movies ever made. Plenty of ACTION and STORY. Gotta love the twists...and Pena and Gyllenhaal play the cool aspect very well."
"OR";"Nice bowls for the price,  they are small but hold just the right amount of food for my cats. Made well,  sturdy for the money. Pleased. You also get two bowls for the price, I believe, for just one."
"OR";"I used one of these on a build I did for a friend and was very impressed with the quality. It was matched with a Vortex Strike Eagle 1-8. A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mou"
"OR";"I enjoyed this story about a arrogant boss and his new employee. I liked the continuation of this families story. I have read serve real of this authors books and this one hit all the right buttons."
"OR";"Using this is homemade dog food. Smells great and our dog seems to like it.  Love that it's made in the USA and has a 30 year history.  Gives me peace of mind that our dog is getting all of the nutrients he needs!"
"OR";"I purchased this book for my significant other, who is totally into fitness and is always looking for ways to improve his physical appearance through exercise and nutrition. Naturally I take interest in anything that would affect his health, so I decided to read the book myself. The book provides co"
"OR";"While some people feel its necessary to write a novel I will keep this short and sweet.  This is a very good turkey injector. Well made and an extremely good value. It does exactly what I purchased it for"
"OR";"What a great evening of chills! It was just as scary & creepy as I remember from watching this movie with my family during my childhood. Holds up well even after all these years. I highly recommend to anyone who loves scary movies."
"OR";"very cute . Looks exactly like the picture . The belt was too small so i ended up giving it to my sister . Shes in love with it . It is the perfect accessory and looks like it cost WAY more than what you pay for it ."
"OR";"Works great. We use these at Cub Scout summer camp.  Me and my son used these and after a day, other dads were asking if I had anymore. You can reseal them in individual bags they come in, which makes them last longer. Would buy again."
"OR";"Works well. I've purchased a number of smaller computer accessories from Mediabridge, and all have worked, and appeared as sturdy and well-make as, say, Belkin. I'm happy to buy their stuff."
"OR";"Worked as expected.

IMO never use one of these behind a TV, the anglked recessed work much better. However, for my use behind a AV stand, worked really well."
"OR";"Our dog loves this dog food. This is an awesome grain free dog food. I used the cat food for years and when we got a dog switched her over to this as well and she seems to love it."
"OR";"I bought this book for my kindle.  I thought the synopsis and preview look good.  I was unable to enjoy the story because parts of pages repeated.  So, I was unable to read the book and enjoy it."
"OR";"I really like this but was a little large.  The quality is there for sure though and would recommend to anyone needing a large collar for a very large dog.  This was too large for my 100 lb. lab mix."
"OR";"This book was so good. Tee and Mercuri's story is full of love and learning how to trust each other unconditionally. They are loyal to their friend who are close to them as siblings. This book is about the power of love and loyalty."
"OR";"set this up on my AR was easy to install and was easy to zero in. I have been to the range 3 times so far no problems good every time out of the box. the battery life seems good still has the one that it came with"
"OR";"I used these for travel pants.  Comfortable and lots of pockets. They have sort of a military/SWAT team look to them. Price was very good for the quality of construction.  They come in several colors so you can change up your look.  Glad I bought them!"
"OR";"I just received it today, tried it for about 1 hour with my new camera: Canon 60D, ir works like a charm & love it :). It looks nice & very good quality. Responsed exelent. If you need it, just buy it & you will not have to return it."
"OR";"I have purchased these in multiple sizes for multiple kids.  Usually great, but for some reason the 8-9 blue check color I got runs a size small.  Grippy bottoms are nice."
"OR";"These things are great. We purchased 2. One for a gift and one for our son. They are fun for everyone to play with and don't make a huge mess. We would definitely purchase again."
"OR";"that's all I can say. love erotica. love all kinds. this was just dumb. Tacky and trashy came to mind and not the fun kind. forced myself to speed read through it to get to the other stories in the boxed set."
"OR";"I bought this for my son and its working much better than the older one I had my son use for target shooting in an indoor range. My son is very happy with these earmuffs. Very happy with the product brand."
"OR";"Smaller than expected, but i am not very good with measurements. Looks good, came clean and  un-damaged. Looks great outside. Got it for the nines an hubby for the back yard. Nice conversation starter."
"OR";"Love the saw.  Does a great job at a reasonable price.

My only issue is the manual, and it's probably not the manufacturer's fault.  It's the lawyers.  With this litigious society we live in, you can no longer get a manual that tells you what to do and how to do it.  It's always a long laundry list"
"OR";"The out fit is beautiful and fits great, love the material and quality.....But there are no panties attached as with most skating outfits also the skates are not as good quality as some others we have purchased. The fall right off the doll and the skate fit is not adequate."
"OR";"Great camera that easy to use, take gorgeous pictures and is easy on the wallet. It's a little small, so if you have large hands, you may be a bit uncomfortable with it, but otherwise, it's great value for the price."
"OR";"One of his best works. George Orwell definitely did a marvelous job of creating a satire piece out of one of the worst authoritarian regimes in world history. It reads well and i highly recommend it."
"OR";"This book was highly informative.  A wonderfully look at Welsh folk lore and a modern day love story.  I would suggest this book for anyone who loves historical novels."
"OR";"Fits great and is very comfortable, however after wearing it one time, I ended up getting a hole in one of the sleeves just doing regular thimgs around the house. I was disappointed it is not as durable for the cost.."
"OR";"The first set of torches I received were not working.  I had to contact amazon customer service and they were excellent in guiding me on how to return it.  I received a set of new torches shortly and only two worked after a few months.  I thought maybe I needed new rechargeable batteries for the two"
"OR";"These work great and have stood the wear and tear of kids. Well built and dependable . Would recommend these to anyone for their children. They get used almost daily"
"OR";"We put this under a small table in our nook. It is a perfect size and will easily hide a small coffee drop until I have time to clean.

This wasn't exactly what I thought it would be but we get onstant compliments. It is perfect."
"OR";"very exciting book.  read it in 3 days cause i couldn't put it down.  would recommend this to everyone.  kerrelyn sparks is a wonderful writer.  cant wait to read her next one in this series."
"OR";"Amazingly comfortable, great sound as well. One of the most well built headphones I have used, even better quality than my 200$ AKG K7XX's, You can wear these things for hours without even noticing you have them on!"
"OR";"I've played three movies thus far, on my Sony Bluray player. They don't start smoothly or precisely, and many extra features play at one-quarter sized image in upper left corner of screen only. ""Niagara"" barely plays at all. Incidentally, this ""collection"" arrived as 9 individual Blurays shrink-wrap"
"OR";"I'm not very good at writing reviews. Thank you so very much for writing all of these wonderful stories. Enjoyed this book. Male alpha, damsel in distress, bad guys. I look forward to more!"
"OR";"now this movie was pretty good it has a real good crash scene in it as well as action it had a good storyline to and the actors were,nt to bad I would give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars."
"OR";"easy to assemble..looks super..plenty big love the extra shelf space ..i am using as a baking center, all my pans and bakery items fit perfectly!! would recommend to a friend!!"
"OR";"What would have happened if I got that letter when I was supposed to? Danny Collins (Pacino) is a rock star who peaked years ago. He is coasting through life playing concerts when he can and playing the same songs over and over. When he is shown a letter that John Lennon wrote him many years before "
"OR";"Love the details on Schleich animals. We keep a zoo and a farm at our house for grandchildren. They love them, and are usually the first choice when they come to our house. Excellent detail and great prices make this a keeper!"
"OR";"This game is very creative, i will give it that. The components are lacking. The little black clips slide around and make it hard for gameplay, as most of us don't remember how many points we have on the cards. One member of our group used some pieces of note card to pad under the clips, it helped i"
"OR";"I really loved this really great story.  I could not put the book down till I finished reading the whole wonderful story.
Thank you so very much for writing this wonderful story."
"OR";"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.

Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, a"
"OR";"Excellent book. Funny, insightful. Puts a modern day angle to the age old questions of good vs. evil. Another great work from two of our best fiction authors."
"OR";"I have taken on two trips and is the perfect size for all your needs kindle, phone etc.
It also doubles as a small range bag and I am sure I will find even more uses for this bag.

Quality is very good"
"OR";"I love this vacuum sealer!  So much more convenient than my other large vacuum!  I keep it on the cabinet and use it several times a day.  Not as fast as the big one but so much easier to use."
"OR";"This light has never worked right. I ordered it for my daughter and she just put in on her bike last week. Just realized it's two days out of return policy, but the blinking light doesn't work."
"OR";"Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers. It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter f"
"OR";"I bought two vests for my wife and I for walking the dog at night - a yellow one for me and this pink one for her.  She loves it, it helps considerably with cars seeing her and it has pockets in the front (my yellow one does not!)"
"OR";"Sometimes a little difficult to get the right bite.  A little uncomfortable after a couple uses.  But you rarely have to use one of these.  And a lot of fittings come with this already.  So now I have a small jar full of them."
"OR";"OMG! What an emotional rollercoaster this book was , I was taken in from the very start and couldn't put it down. Wow I loved Hector he is my new favorite hot bunch guy! This book proves once again that they just keep getting better."
"OR";"This is a little larger than I expected. However, it fits well under the helmet and keeps my head warm. I do have a good bit of wind noise around the ears while wearing this item."
"OR";"Great characters. They were interesting and strong. The storyline is about healing and giving into love . Was surprised, has alot of  sexual situations that I was not expecting because I thought it would be more like a Christian book."
"OR";"This movie is pretty cute and great for younger kids (older kids may get a little bored).  Anyone who likes hand drawn animation will really appreciate this movie."
"OR";"I read other reviews which said to buy half a size larger, as is normal with a dance shoe, but they were huge when I got them.  I would've been fine with my normal size. Good quality shoe, however."
"OR";"I bought these for my little one year old granddaughter who love them and so does her 3 year old brother. They are so cute and so well made. They truly are great quality."
"OR";"Love it! .......... sooooo comfortable you can't go wrong with one of these ..... washed up great as well.  I used warm wash and med dry.  Nice length, even for me  (I am 5'10"")."
"OR";"We did not have a lot of success with this product. USB devices worked better. As I recall we had some setup problems and well and it's still setting in a drawer in a desk someplace. Would not buy again."
"OR";"Great product, we live out in the country and have no city lights. For our dog that we allow to run off leash this works great. We can see him as would our neighbors be able to if he got into the road. The battery life is good but not awesome."
"OR";"This really was a great find for a girl who loves  Barbie. The accessories alone that are included are well worth the price and we had no issues with the mechanics of the vending machine. Would buy again definitely!"
"OR";"My cats love, love, love this scratcher.  Tried various ones to keep them from scratching furniture.  This is the one they chose.  I have about four of these and they are all holding up well, showing little wear, and getting much use from three cats."
"OR";"Sending a shout out to the author-Julie Bailes.  Thank you for the gift of your book.  I told you I'd review and here I am.  Just got done with this book.  What a rollercoaster ride of emotions?!  Ali, the lead female, has endured heartbreaking loss multiple times and yet she endures.  Blake has bee"
"OR";"Great glasses; perfect size for lattes.  They keep the drinks really hot without burning your fingers.  I bought two and now I want to buy two more!  A little on the expensive side... but you get what you pay for."
"OR";"Small, but put out good light! Hung in the alley beside restaurant, and light up the dark space well for the passing customers. Do not get a lot of direct sunlight but still work well."
"OR";"Seem pretty good, but I haven't really worn them for a couple hours at a time. I had return my 1st pair and get a bigger size & these were a little tight, but after a few wears they are about perfect."
"OR";"I was hoping for a story for Adam and Cullen, and I got one this is a really good book . The only part I did not like, is the sex outside in front of everybody I just think that's something that should be private."
"OR";"I enjoyed this book, although I completed the course in less than 10 weeks.  It was a great way to study the Bible in the quiet surrounds of my home.  I would recommend this book and look forward to others by this author."
"OR";"I enjoyed this story.  I was a little disappointed when it came to an end, but I guess that all good things must come to an end.  Perhaps there is another story that pucks up where this one left off."
"OR";"Wanted to see how closely the movie stayed w/the book:  extremely well, considering how movies often don't meet the book's detail or message. The book I hadn't read, so now I know both movie and book are great."
"OR";"I am obsessed with mason jars. As someone that cans, I always have mason jars on hand. I use them for everything possible. I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They a"
"OR";"Love the whole series, very family friendly, clean language, beautiful colors, cute story.  But then I love those kinds of movies. Whole series is good for adults or children."
"OR";"I liked the familiarity between the two friends, Katie and Aaron, and when she comes to the realization that he is the perfect man for her, even thought it doesn't fit into her plans, she takes a chance on him.  A good short read!!"
"OR";"Very easy to follow, not too hard but got my body moving.  I have been using it all week so far and look forward to it.  It's amazing how moving around a little more than often can have a big effect.  Nice DVD."
"OR";"The one I ordered didn't work even when I changed out the batteries. Apparently reading the feedback I am not the only one this has happened to. Nothing against the seller but this product looks unreliable. It's cute, but it doesn't work half the time..."
"OR";"Son loves the sound and they look nice but the leather like material around the ear pads has come off and no real way to secure it back.  Only had them since Christmas."
"OR";"These are ok, but just cheap plastic. I'm keeping them because the grand kids will enjoy them, but I bought better ones for the bug out bags.
Not really pleased, just ok.
Another review by Rick's wife :-)"
"OR";"It's a decent read though not the normal type of book I like to read. It's basically a book of short stories about the people who have found messages in a bottle& abbreviated versions of what the messages said."
"OR";"My kids LOVE this beanie boo!!  It's so cute and cuddly. The small size (approx. 6"") makes is very portable too! I have already bought 10+ of these beanie boos to give as gifts!"
"OR";"Product is as described and arrived in great condition. It was packaged well, and it is so pretty on my chihuahua. The size is perfect. My dog loves it too. I highly recommend this Polo Shirt !"
"OR";"I received this book for my honest opinion. I liked Cash because it show a guy who never forget where he came from. Jenna had that down to earth attitude, I loved the book read it in one day."
"OR";"On the off chance that like me you've read Big Chief Elizabeth and Samurai William (or at least one of them), it may be worth me stating that in my opinion this is the least impressive of the three. In agreement with the review below, Nathaniel's 'story occupies only a small part of this book', and "
"OR";"I purchased this as a gift for my daughters first birthday. The doll is smaller than I expected, but it is the perfect size for my daughter to carry around. I wish it didn't have the artificial fragrance, but it is not overwhelming and better than the smell of plastic."
"OR";"its a compact bag. if you want carry more things. its better you bought bigger one. its tight fit bag. if you want to buy bag for only camera its a good one."
"OR";"Interesting book topic but difficult to read because of lack of cohesiveness in each chapter. I've put the book several times-- I'm usually a fast ready but this book seems to drag on!"
"OR";"This is  an enjoyable short story.  Written in 1999,  it is one of the first books to introduce us to the world of Harmony.  I only gave it 3 stars because of its length.  Jayne Castle is an excellent author and I do recommend the book."
"OR";"This chandelier is simply beautiful.  At first I was wondering if the LED light bulbs would reflect nicely from the crystal.  The white light actually reflects and refracts much nicer. I hired an electrician to install this chandelier and another bigger one I bought on Amazon.  The strings with the "
"OR";"I love how RE takes you on a journey every single book she writes. I am going to hate to see this series end. There is so much  stress today, it is nice to have a place you can go to for a little while with a HEA."
"OR";"Bought 2 of these for my Blade Nano Fpv quad to see if they were as great as advertised.  One powered it for 3:30, the other wouldn't make it to 3:00.  I've had cheaper batteries that performed better."
"OR";"The material is durable and plush at the same time. I went by the size chart and the harness fits my dog great. It looks amazing!! I absolutely love it, people ask me all the time where I purchased it."
"OR";"I had never heard of either one of these woman before watching this movie. I've watched it a few times, however I stop before the end, which makes me sad.  It is a well acted and well made film."
"OR";"Works perfectly. I just rec'd and used this for the first time. I actually bought two of them, one for me and one for my daughter overseas. I don't own a big machine, but I wanted to try this. I didn't have an issue with the little slit in the valve."
"OR";"Cats had no interest in this toy. I didn't want to give it a one star because the quality is great, and it's just too cute. But, I don't want to rate it high either because my cats are usually interested in everything and anything!"
"OR";"Nice tool with little to no overage of material when you stop squeezing the trigger.price point pretty good for a quality feeling gun. I would buy another."
"OR";"This was a great sequel to the first book.  Also they seemed to have corrected the proofreading problems that were inherent in the first book, Polar Bear Dawn.  If you haven't already give them a try."
"OR";"Did not work at all...my dogs ran right through it with out even a second of hesitation. Unfortunately I waited too long to try it out, so it is past the return policy! DO NOT BUY for large dogs...it might work for a cat!"
"OR";"Cannot say enough GOOD things about this book, and the series as a whole. The author is amazingly creative and I was drawn into the book at the first sentence. Can't wait to see what comes next!"
"OR";"I have read this whole serious and really enjoy it..this was one of the better books in the series..I would recommend the series to anyone that enjoys these types of books.."
"OR";"Overall, it fits a little looser than what I was looking for, but since I didn't realize it was a ""loose fit"" when I purchased the item that's to be expected. It's still a really comfortable hoodie and I wear it quite often."
"OR";"I bought this for a nephew. He and I love classic rock and who doesnt love Zeppelin? The colors are beautiful, the fabric is excellent and is true to size. Im going to order myself one. You won't be disappointed"
"OR";"This is well made and works OK, but the bulb has a tendency to fall off of the stainless baster shaft, especially when it gets wet. Overall, it works well, I just wish the bulb fit better."
"OR";"As with all the ""I'll read to you, You read to me"" books, these are GREAT for parent-child reading at home, or peer reading at school.  I've used them with 1st - 4th graders to build fluency.  They never seem to tire of practicing!"
"OR";"Can't say enough good things about this item.  Works great, easy to read, smooth retraction, english and metric scales, 30' long.  What more can you want?"
"OR";"Definitely suspenseful. Great comic relief. A great story.  It is wonderful to read a true love story, and one not based on carnal lust. A beautiful story."
"OR";"This story was exciting from the get go.  Why couldn't men like that be real?  Only makes you want to live in books.  Can only dream of having someone like that.  Now to get back to real life."
"OR";"Nice heavy weight fabric.  Washes and dries perfectly. All of the stains came right out and they looked like brand new after use.
I would highly recommen this item."
"OR";"Good for year round use.  Amazon has XS sizes when no department store has XS, score! It is now my favorite nightie.  Fabulous fabric.  Good styling.  Love it.  Get it."
"OR";"Looks like it will work! This is the best price I've found.  Hoping our pup learns to love it.  In way better condition that the one we purchased at P###m##t (which had some bent sections and costs more)."
"OR";"Great start!  A much more believable stat to the life style then some of the stories I've read.  Pulled me into the story right away and can't wait to see where they go from here."
"OR";"this bota bag is awsome , perfect size , strong strap , really well made . a true spanish product , (no chinese knock off here) . easy to fill , and drink from , water or wine . a great buy ."
"OR";"I was so looking forward to this book.  I love the series and couldn't wait for this book to come.  I'm not going to spoil it for those who decide to pay this outrageous price for this book.  This book was seriously lacking from her other novels.  If not just down right boring."
"OR";"Fun read, hard to put it down. I would have liked to see more involvement with Samantha, like they did in the movie. But, all-in-all, it was a good time, money well spent!"
"OR";"I bought it because it was free and will buy more by this author.  It was a novella but the story was complete with a few surprises.  I highly recommend Allegra's Song and can't wait to read the stories about the two sisters."
"OR";"This book was raw with emotion from page 1 and starts from after that awful day that changed Diana from the carefree person she was to a person who struggles daily with demons.  You can not help but to feel for Diana, wishing that she would get better.  Gideon was an amazing character even with all "
"OR";"Nice small ""B.O.B"" if this is being considered as a 72 hour pack without packing clothing I would recommend it... It's small but useful in it's own way, I found the construction of the product to be very well made.."
"OR";"I just can't say enough how good this series is. Paced well, the story continues to draw you in and you really care about the characters. I love the way it flows and Amber has created such a great community with amazing people in it!"
"OR";"This stuff seems to work.  We foster cats and ringworm is a constant problem as many feral cats carry the fungus and it is easily transmitted from cat to cat.  It is a bit expensive, but I cannot complain as it seems to work.  We applied it to a all white cat that had developed the classic ""bald"" sp"
"OR";"My 9 year old son LOVES this set.  He learned how to play Uno on a campout with friends and this is now his favorite game, especially on the heels of the awesome recent Avengers movie."
"OR";"Perfect.  This brand has excellent strong-smelling catnip that doesn't seem to wear off quickly.  These are good little sized toys that will be going to three different cats for the holidays; I know they'll be loved."
"OR";"Really enjoyed it as each MI movie has gotten better as the series progresses. The opening sequence gets you started in a great way and the movie never disappoints."
"OR";"This is a very sad and difficult story to read, but probably one that should be read so as to have understanding of what some people go through. It is well written and thought provoking but doesn't leave one with much hope."
"OR";"A trick played, one played back and attractions become true love.  A little sappy but vey cute story.  The characters were nice and the story was cute."
"OR";"Better than the second film of the series.  Some deviation from the book, but not as jarring as the changes in ""Desolation of Smaug"".  Tie ins to LOTR were done well without hurting the original story."
"OR";"Got this book also because it was included in many of the Berkelee School of Music Business courses. Loved the writing itself and also had some very unique perspectives for those in bands as well as those working on the business side of things. I think the subject matter itself is absolutely relevan"
"OR";"Love these jeans. They run slightly large based on where they sit on your hips. The newer ones have a little Lycra so you may want to try a size smaller. They hold the stretch after you wear them once."
"OR";"The audible that I bought along with it only went half way through the book. This is a long and repetitive book with English from the 1800s that makes it slow and difficult to read. An updated version may be preferable."
"OR";"Our 13 month old son LOVES this toy - can be used outdoors on a water table/pool & inside for bath time. Great for working on motor skills and water play!"
"OR";"This swimming suit set is absolutely adorable!! I love the look of this, it is perfect for any little girl, the colors go beautifully together! The suit itself is a pale champagne pink color, the skirt part of this is made of shaggy white tulle. The swan is embroidered on to the suit, the beak of th"
"OR";"What an awesome read! Melanie Shawn masterly crafted this suspense-filled romance that I could not put down! This is the first book in this series I've read and I'm going back and reading the other four ASAP!"
"OR";"Cute read. I love Carter, he is a manly man. It is  a well written short story and fast paced. The sex scenes are well written and steamy. Fern and Carter light up the pages."
"OR";"Good, but I didn't like it quite as much as the first two in this series.  I am not sure why.  I did like the characters and the action was there as with most typical romantic suspense novels.  Worth a read for sure."
"OR";"I do a lot of Homebrew. This pot is perfect. Easy to clean, just the right size: big enough for 5 gallon brews but not too large to store. I would recommend this to anyone with similar needs."
"OR";"This little guy is really cute and my son has been enjoying using him to eat his worries. We empty it out at night and talk about the worries so it helps start the discussion as well. This is made well and is soft."
"OR";"This is amazing! It makes a crackle sound that doesn't drive me crazy. The squeaker toys drive me a little crazy. My huge dog loves it and has not destroyed it! Perfect size for a big dog."
"OR";"Started at the beginning of the Alex Cross series and I can't wait for the next book as I get through each.
I'm glad that he has other series I can read once I finish the Cross books.
Thank you for writing in the way that keeps me wanting more!"
"OR";"Bought these as a gift for a friend for his birthday and he loved them!
They fit great. They were little more red than maroon color shown.
I'd only be concerned with how the hold up they didn't feel that sturdy."
"OR";"I bought this for my sons 15th birthday. He loves it and has a lot of fun. It flies VERY high for a toy and the camera is awesome. You download the app and use as the control screen. Very easy to lose, its white."
"OR";"This is the second book by Patchett that I have read. State of Wonder being the first. The author pulls you in to both books, beautifully written, and both have a very abrupt ending. I have to say I am disappointed once again with her books, she tells some great stories and leaves the reade hanging "
"OR";"The first thought that comes to mind when thinking of this book is funny. It had me laughing out loud. There were other areas that kept you enthralled and those that reintroduced Tiffany's parents. I really like her sidekick, Ian as well."
"OR";"Yup, this is the real one. Amazon is great to have good and trustworthy sellers!

I have used this to balance charge and store both S2 & S3 batteries. I don't have other size. This is a solid charger with great and easy to use interface!"
"OR";"I really like this doll.  Her stilts make her fun and interesting and her hair came out looking great - sometimes the curly haired ones end up messy and all over the place."
"OR";"Can't beat Badger! Sturdy, easy to assemble, fun-to-use products. Our house now looks like a nursery with the high-chair, crib and several other products we have purchased for our 2-year old granddaughter. She loves them all."
"OR";"This is an awesome radio! I have two and showed it to my friend and she ordered one to. Great sound, Great battery life, Charges my Ipod with ease, Lightweight... Over all this deserves 1000 stars in my book."
"OR";"Price. Sturdy. I'm pleased I bought two, although I'm certain the one in use is going to last a long time. Highly recommend."
"OR";"Was hell of tight fit into the sump well, took me 3-4 times to get just right positioning, thereafter it works just fine. So when you install it, make sure it absolutely will NOT catch on anything."
"OR";"Son loves the thing carries it around with him. Loud lots of bass has it paired to iPhone and Samsung tablet. Uses it to charge his phone on car trips. Very good quality and excellent sound"
"OR";"buy a size slightly larger...
Chilly Dog Cable Dog Sweater,  which I have reviewed and is without any constraints in
covering the dog quickly and better by far!  you get what you pay for."
"OR";"Bought this for my 14 year old daughter. She loves it. Just wish I'd bought it at Christmas time...before she cracked the screen.
Perfect fit. Top quality product.
Arrived in two days!"
"OR";"I love the NIV One-a-Day Chronological Bible.  I am able to read thru the Bible in my favorite translation in the order it was written in 1 year.  It is a great Book to read.  I recommend it to everyone."
"OR";"Alpha male meets curvy girl. Apparently what he wants is what he gets. And what he wants more then anything is her. How far will they give into each other and did he really do it??? Well can't wait to read book two."
"OR";"Fits my lab/American bull dog mix perfect, size L. Is definitely not a no-pull harness though. Probably helps him pull more. Great harness though, for those dogs trained well."
"OR";"I absolutely love this Dutch Oven!  Already made several dishes using it.  A friend of mine had it and loved it, so I got one for myself.  Highly recommended if you love cooking stews, sauce, chili, etc."
"OR";"I've used your product before on other tablets. I don't think I would used anything else.
Great packaging, like triple layer protection.
Fast shipping and easy to apply."
"OR";"I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the"
"OR";"Easy to use, perfect size for the kids, they loved being able to walk around the yard on them. When going downhill the small size made them easy to control."
"OR";"I bought this to wear during running, to be able to wipe the sweat off my face. It looks/feels like it will work very well and will suck up the sweat. Feels soft and light, and made well - great for running or any other sport."
"OR";"So far they are very comfortable for all the walking I do at work!  They are also really nice looking eye fit good, and they don't make me feel like I'm going to roll my ankle all day like some other dress shoes."
"OR";"These are great every day sandles only thing is the toe gets caught sometimes when I walk and it tears up immediately the first time . I normally wear a size 7.5 I ordered an 8 and they fit well"
"OR";"I thought the first one was awesome, but this one was even better their story was even more fun, probably because of the other stories involved.
Really enjoying these stories."
"OR";"I love these speakers. They work well, the price is great and im actually ordering a second set. I use these with my iPhone, iPod and computer. The cords are long so I can put them whereever I need to and the sound quality is wonderful."
"OR";"It's a very cute dress but WAY too small. Yes, it is very stretchy & a thicker material, but I wish I got two sizes up instead of one. I'm a curvy size 10/12 and the XL was not big enough."
"OR";"I was hoping the sizing was right. It fits perfectly and is beautiful. I got a size small and wear a 4 or 6. Fits like it was made for me. Love the colors."
"OR";"This is impossible to keep clean.  I empty the water completely and refill daily, and I take the stupid thing apart and clean it thoroughly weekly, but it still gets slimy and icky.  Taking it apart and cleaning should be simple and straightforward.  They are not.  Even with sponges, bottle brushes "
"OR";"Although I love Sue Grafton's novels, I felt this one was not up to her usual standard. The stories were disjointed and the ending was abrupt. Still worth reading but not her strongest story."
"OR";"the item arrived on time and worked as it was supposed to but my pda slipped and the little prongs broke so i have to use tape to keep it in til i can figure out how to get the broken prongs out and buy another one"
"OR";"This was my first book by Ms Roberts and let me tell you it will not be my last! Wasn't sure I would like it, the hero is not your usual, but holy smokes..it is an amazing read!
Don't miss this one!!"
"OR";"great item! no more need to sit right by outlet. made well. my old style still works after years with ipad 2. now with ipad air, new style is very good after months of use."
"OR";"My daughter has small and narrow feet-these fit well and do not slip off as much. The heel-strap is padded and comfortable. Very cute :) I got size 4/5 and she is 12 months old."
"OR";"They are super comfy. Really the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever had. They actually fit larger than average, so pick a size at least 0.5 smaller than your usual size. Very recommended."
"OR";"The book was okay a new author for me. Not as attention grabbing as it could be and had a hard time staying with the story. Was interesting in some places and would try another book maybe from this author."
"OR";"As the author predicted, it took a very long time to read this trilogy but the very fact that I read it to the last page is proof that it is more than good. I ached for the friendship of Blays and Dante. I wanted a love for Dante."
"OR";"Just the price and size for my wife and myself. I have cooked 7 meals since we bought it and its great.  The Crock comes out and goes right into the dishwasher as well as the cover.  Best Crock Pot we have had so far in many a year."
"OR";"Detective stories don't get much better than this. It felt so real I was sure I knew these people. Lots of believable, unexpected and surprising twists and turns. Looking forward to the next story."
"OR";"I bought the dinosaur set and it's super cute but runs extremely small! I bought a size up but wish I bought 2 sizes up because I don't think my daughter will be able to wear them for very long."
"OR";"The kids loved these at the glow party! It kept them busy more so than the actual activities I had planned for them. Great purchase and would definitely buy again just for the kids to have at home. Some went out at times, just tap them and the light back up"
"OR";"Really good price but really thin bully sticks. Of course, it doesn't matter to the dogs; they all love them, but it takes them only about 15 minutes to consume. It would have been 5 stars if they were thicker."
"OR";"Sound is good, call quality is great as long as you're not out in windy conditions.  Battery life is good.  Very comfortable.  Controls could be a little easier to identify, but they all work great with a Galaxy S5.  Very pleased."
"OR";"Oh my gosh, this set is adorable. It is so much better quality than I expected and very well made.

The fabrics are all nice and thick and everything is quilted and padded and double/triple layered fabrics. I expected something thin and sort of cheap like dress up clothes, but it is nothing like tha"
"OR";"Mr. Backman develops his characters so well that one forgets he/she is reading a book!  I find myself understanding and sympathizing with the ""people...even the ones I don't like!"
"OR";"Got for my 5 year old son and Georgie couldn't hear or respond to him. My husband and I had to do it, and it couldn't always underdtand us which was frustrating. The quality of it is good, and it's very cute, just ended up not working out for us."
"OR";"I purchased this belt because the XL was too small. Well, of course this belt is too big. I will be adding another hole to make it fit me. I wish there were a size in between the two, otherwise it's a good purchase."
"OR";"Small, simple works great.
The display is a bit bright, I ended up covering it with clear tape, then using a blue marker and inking the tape.
Using the voltmeter on a Motorcycle."
"OR";"I bought this book for my husband.  He works for a woman.  This book had great insight plus he enjoyed it.  A must read for all..upper management or those who are just starting out.  It doesn't matter if you are male or female....there is something for everyone.  Good for bosses, too."
"OR";"Great quality and fit. But, I haven't worn one in a very long time.  Perhaps someone can help me!  Should a man wear an under-shirt and or a dress shirt (with a collar) under the top of the kimono?  Or not?  Thanks"
"OR";"The snake is long and pops out great but the can is impossible to open. I couldn't do it. My husband had to work at it. Going to try a regular chip can like one review said and I'll see how it works"
"OR";"This is a great looking watch!  The watch has a great feel to it and is very versatile.  It looks great with dark and earth tone clothes.  Also casual and business attire.  Can't miss with this one."
"OR";"Very high quality kennel for my large cats. This one is even nicer than the one I bought from my local petsmart store, and I believe it was cheaper!

My large cats fit very well in this 24-inch kennel."
"OR";"WhooHoo! No Chubb rub! But they do take some getting used to wearing. I wear them under dresses and I was constantly thinking they would show because they do go down a bit low. But it's a good product."
"OR";"This is super quiet,  works great keeps my laptop cool. The blue light it has makes it look great,  it is also helpful to see the keys in the dark."
"OR";"The best.  You get several toys in one.  Sound when snail moves is hilarious and so clear.  My daughter loved this toy.  Because of the design and multiple toys in one, it lasts through several stages of development."
"OR";"It was good. There was one part I did not like, the 3rd person in the room during intimate times. There was only one or two instances of this behavior, but I thought it would have been better if it was kept just between the couple. I appreciated that only he was allowed to discipline."
"OR";"Very comfortable sandal, and I took the advice of previous reviews and ordered one size up. Perfect fit. Able to wear all day long. Would love to have more, in every color."
"OR";"These worked great and have held up through the daily washing for weeks. Easy to put in and get off and our puppy didn't seem to mind them so they must be comfortable. (She's never worn outfits before so I worried about this) Fabulous product!"
"OR";"Great kit for cleaning your SLR. I used this to remove the oil spots on the sensor of my D600 and it worked like a champ. I like the little pen cleaners too and the blower is pretty solid."
"OR";"My problem- I didn't check the dimensions. Smaller than I expected and wanted but as described-kinda. The pouch will hold a tennis ball (if you push hard) but not a ball  and treats. The outside pouch will not hold a tennis ball , for the size it will hold, that size is small enough to choke your do"
"OR";"A true classic. Tales from the hood is the  best anthology film ever made. From beginning to end the movie gets better and better. One of the best movies ever made."
"OR";"It was a good period story and a good read and rendered good conversation.  Our book club is varied ages and from all over the country and England.  It was fun to hear what was going on with everyone during that era."
"OR";"It's a fine costume.  The sizing runs a bit funny.  This small was too small for my 5 year old boy  He's a bit tall for his age.  But when I bought the next size up it was huge on him.  We had to return it."
"OR";"I bought these way too lengthy but since they are excellent cables i don't mind. Will find a use for the 80ft i have left (haha). Get these with some banana plugs and you're good to go."
"OR";"Love Deborah book, she is a talented writer another great read. I loved Garret and Vanessa great chemistry. I felt like I was right there with them."
"OR";"I purchased a system from Lorex and when I opened the box, it was missing parts, so Lorex said that I had to purchase $50 worth of parts (power cord, remote control & mouse) to make it work. Yes... those items should have been in the box (as stated on the box). After buying the parts and plugging it"
"OR";"Pretty good assortment of o rings.  Have used several when working on car emission parts, etc., replaced old ones that I would not have made a trip to the store to replace otherwise.  Great to have around."
"OR";"Nice LED bulbs for a pretty good price. They are very bright. We've been using them probably an average of 5 hours everyday for a couple months now. Hopefully they last for many years."
"OR";"What a well written story!  Keeps you guessing right to the end, and as an added bonus bring the plight of elephants front and center.

I couldn't put this book down.  Glad our Book Club chose to read it."
"OR";"Wow, just loved this book. Great storyline. Can't wait to read the next in this series to find out how the brothers find their mates and if they come across Alana and have to do battle with her somehow to protect their mates."
"OR";"I really love this ladle.  It fills my bowl with one scoop or maybe two.  It's attractive & cleans easily, love it.
This one was a gift and my friend loves it."
"OR";"A great movie with all of the dark mood you could ever want. There are other movies with similar story lines but this one was very well done.  I highly recommend it if you would like to see a good large Budget horror/suspence movie."
"OR";"I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into this series. I got the package early, which was nice and I started reading right away. It is a quick moving story, but so worth it to read. You will not be able to put the book down!"
"OR";"Peggy Henderson's Blemished Brides series just keeps getting better and better; In His Arms is my favourite by far. Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumst"
"OR";"Medium is a little too long in the legs for my 3 pound morkie. But she will grow into it. The rest fits her body well. Love the color and very warm.  She looks adorable in it! Very happy with my purchase."
"OR";"My husband needed plain pants for work dress code of office casual, but no jeans. I ordered these for him and they are perfect. Made from good quality fabric. Fit true to size."
"OR";"Great concept, cute, interesting and funny characters and just enough spooky stuff to keep the story edgy. Fast paced, funny, out there read that's a real hoot. Highly recommend it."
"OR";"I purchased a purple harness for my shih-poo and he loves it!!
It is gentle on his chest and whenever he wants to run, you softly pull him back and it does not chock him like a collar. It was good quality and awesome color selections!"
"OR";"I absolutely love the print of this sarong. Red is my favorite color its looks wonderful on me. This is my first sarong, its light weight and flowey, draping nice on my body. Ill be ordering another one"
"OR";"I feel like i need to go back and read this book again.  I felt it was very repetitive and not applicable to most.  I'd love to be able to quit work, move to the beach and relax.  That's simply not an option."
"OR";"All three of these books were written by Linda Lael Miller and I would say that all of them were very good books.  I have read the rest of the books in the series and they have also been good.
I would recommend this author to anyone who likes cowboy romance books."
"OR";"What a great action packed God fearing story.
I would love to hear not about this town of Serenity Springs, Ohio. I have only read two of Lillian Duncan's stories but I won't be stopping with these. Great job."
"OR";"I'm 5' 10"" and weigh 175lbs. Got the extra large because of my big shoulders but don't like a baggy shirt. These fit great and so far have washed very well. I will be buying more in other colors."
"OR";"I thought I was well versed in American history until I read this book.  I had never heard of the sand creek massacre before I read this book.  Should be required reading in all history classes"
"OR";"Works great, good construction. The Velcro is nice just keep it clean. Its a bit hefty so if your catcher looks up and quick brings his head back down, pending the position it can hang up a little. Overall recommend the product."
"OR";"Well, I just finished number eight. So glad to know there will be more. Every brother has had a different story with the most unusual women. I loved each book and couldn't wait to finish. Now I will look forward to reading them again in a few months."
"OR";"I loved this story!  Couldn't stop reading all the way thru until the end. The H and h were easy to get to know  and I  wanted to keep going to learn how the other characters  stories turn out as well. I will be looking for more books by this author."
"OR";"Little awkward having to use the battery lugs and keep the engine running  -  -  -  I gotta use the pick-up since the hose won' reach the rear wheels  BUT the unit work great."
"OR";"It looks great in my tank; it's easy to pick up debris from it, my betta loves to rest on the ground (I had rainbow gravel before; it was a nightmare). I bought a second bag because one wasn't enough for my 10 gallon."
"OR";"This is my first Lorna Landvik book and I thought it was charming!  Written all in e-mails, it takes a while to sort out who's who, but once I started it, didn't put it down until I finished it!  (Fortunately, it was a short book!).  Will definitely be reading more of Landvik!"
"OR";"These are perfect for my 2month old. Still a little big but room for him to grow. (6month ones). They don't ever fall off like socks. I'd ordered some for my SIL as a baby shower gift!"
"OR";"These dough rolling guides are AWESOME. It's great that the set had three sizes. I needed a much thinner dough than I anticipated, so I just used the next size down and rolled again.  They worked great.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
"OR";"Great read......this books is filled with its highs and lows in this story.  Ericka is looking for her best friend Tia all while trying to figure out the real man that her father is.....looking forward to part 2."
"OR";"Cute!!! Our 10 year old loves this, she is tinier then most kids her age, slender and shorter so if your child is big for her size go up in size. It isn't itchy material either,"
"OR";"The weapon fits well but the paddle part wobbles a little.  Other than that it's a pretty good holster as long as you don't need a retaining strap.  Good for concealed carry but not so much for open carry."
"OR";"Nothing fancy, got exactly what I ordered. Looks nice and can't beat it for the price.  Does not have that cheap feel to it.  Wears and looks
like I paid twice the price for it."
"OR";"I like how easy is to put on the dog, but even thought it says ""X-Small"" it's not small enough for our 12 week Maltese.  It's way too big on him now.  We will wait to use it on him when he gets a bit bigger.  Over all, the harness is easy to use."
"OR";"Maybe its wicked but Alexa Rileys stories are like a fairy tales, only for adults. Kinky, steamy, and naughty fairy tales. And who does not like a good tales before bedtime?

The blurb really say it all. Alexander bought land with mansion on it, where he wants to build a airstrip for his plane. He i"
"OR";"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three contine"
"OR";"These are the real deal!  Ive ordered the cheaper ones and even though they say they come with screws they dont. These do and they are much more sturdy. I will buy these from now on and save a trip to the hardware store for screws"
"OR";"I just wish I didn't have to wear ANY goggles, but being that I do, I am glad to have found these. They do not leak and are comfortable enough. They keep my eyes free of chlorine and other irritants.

I live in a condo with an indoor pool. Or should I say I live in a pool with an indoor condo, being"
"OR";"My son received this for Christmas. He loves it. We both agree that we wish it didn't have the red tip, but understand why it does. This is well made, unlike some other received stated. Might even surprise my daughter with the pink one."
"OR";"Great size to take to the market; you can fill them up with a lot of produce without them becoming so heavy that the handles break. Great reusable option because they don't take up a ton of space as some other bags do."
"OR";"My dad received this as a gift. He loves photography and this made him think he was getting a new lens. Excellent work maKing a replica! Good deal, good seal, nice cosmetics and texture."
"OR";"Very nice bag. Fits a Ruger MK3 Hunter with a reflex sight no problem. Good zippers, good material, good size. Highly recommended."
"OR";"Works very good and I like then a lot. I was a little bummed that one of the rubber war covers fell off and I can't locate it. But I never did check to make sure they were secure (you are giventhree sizes)."
"OR";"I have read James Kipling's books and thoroughly enjoyed them. This one, I had to force myself to read. The ending sucked big time. I can't say it in any other way. Very disappointed. So fake. So unbelievable."
"OR";"It's not huge. But it fits my really large cats perfect. I like this product and highly recommend it. I've had mine for two years and I wash the filters and have yet to change them out."
"OR";"I like the story line and the characters had potential but I felt the story was rushed and jumped to much I couldn't enjoy it as much as I usually enjoy shifter stories. Has potential when the next one comes out."
"OR";"This was a hot short story, but as another reviewer pointed out, I was disappointed it was all a dream. It seemed a little cliche. Still, it was well written. I wish it had been longer. I'd have loved scenes from his pov."
"OR";"not such a strong light, I have purchased a type like this before and the other light was bigger and brighter and has been outside in use for more than 7 months.
this light is small, cheap to the touch , lets see how long it last?"
"OR";"Bought from different store, works great he even put on traxxas connector for me. Couldn't get past 3/4 throttle in Cul-de-sac, my other batteries get full throttle this makes slash fast."
"OR";"I started giving this to my dog after she had ACL surgery and I think it keeps her in better shape. It's hard to find, so I'm glad Amazon carries it and at a great price."
"OR";"This product really works...I've been using it for years for my female Chesapeake Retreiver.  No brown spots on my lawn!  If that's your problem this will do the trick for you.  Great product and she likes the taste of them with or without food."
"OR";"I found that i got hung up on what i preceived to be a lot of historical inaccuracies rather than enjoy the story. Only to discover that at the end, the author explained all of it in the author notes. It would have been a more enjoyable read had those been at the beginning of the book."
"OR";"I just  purchased my second Black and Decker iron.  The first one performed well for a couple of hard-working years and I didn't hesitate to purchase the same model again. A good buy and a great iron."
"OR";"Both my kids loved these toys (we had two over the course of  years) as babies. We dragged them everywhere, used them as rattles, teethers, comfort toys. I always buy it for my friends who are to become parents for the first time."
"OR";"Julie Smith is a good writer, but could not get a really great taste of old New Orleans in this one.  Will go back to her full length books."
"OR";"One of the true great books written about war in Afghanistan. I must read for everyone, especially those who love true war stories. Excellent and amazing bravery among soldiers of Red Platoon."
"OR";"Great little knife. Blade was a little shorter than expected but I didn't fully review this in the specs. Nice case and burl handle. Definitely recommend  as a great gift choice that would be remembered."
"OR";"Omg thank you for making this available it smells so good my cat always seems to need a bath. This makes both of our lives so much better she doesn't mind this one bit"
"OR";"Can it be book 2 was better than one. Oh yeah definitely I love delvin so much more after this oh my. Twists and turns and secrets. Yes please. This is a absolute MUST READ SERIES. I am addicted."
"OR";"These are really great little binoculars to use with 2-5 year old kids. We have them in several classrooms at the daycare center that I run. They can stand up to repeated ROUGH use and are a nice bright color."
"OR";"Great toy bbought second hand at a kids sale. Only paid $20 well worth it nitnis noisy but my sone loves it. He puts toys inside lots of fun"
"OR";"I didn't drop 7 pounds (I didn't lose anything and was very diligent) but I did find out that I'm sensitive to my favorite foods.  I've changed my eating habits because of reading this book."
"OR";"Very involved!  Page turner and informative about Brian, his son!!!  I love the Michael Bennett series and all of the Family as well as Mary Catherine!!!  Cant wait for the next book in this series!"
"OR";"These are very sturdy and well made.

My daughter loves the faces and we use them to practice making faces and telling what they are.

They've been used as hats or balance tools for walking across. So many more uses than I would have thought."
"OR";"We gave this to our 3 year old nephew for Christmas and he loved it.  He carried Caillou around with him during most of our visit.  As for durability, only time will tell.  But so far so good.  Caillou still has all his limbs!"
"OR";"This was a DVD for my 2 year old grand daughter
Seller did a great job arrive red before the said price was perfect and she will love it DVD is like new"

"OR";"Oh this one really was nice!  I followed this story from beginning to end.  Tears were coming left and right with this book.  Be prepared for a real tear jerker.  That's all I'm going to say."
"OR";"This book answered a lot of questions that the previous books in this series had raised. It was a good stand- alone but also it fit well into the previous set of stories."
"OR";"This book is a must read, garret and Vanessa  are great characters, their chemistry is electrifying. You have to read this book, it's awesome. Can't wait for part two."
"OR";"These are made well, they don't leak one bit, I'm very happy with this purchase. I would buy again. Don't hesitate to buy. Great seal on the inside."
"OR";"Just what I was looking for, magnets seem to be strong. Looks to be another great product of Klein. Would buy again, in hvac industry so most likely will. would recommend to a friend."
"OR";"This is one of the movies that you I can watch over and over again.  I ordered it because my husband and I collect movies and we simply realized we did not have this one.  Which is a mistake.  If you like silly comedies (like Tommy Boy, Dumb & Dumber, ect) then this movie is for you!"
"OR";"Like many other reviews, i grow with the old Smurfs cartoons, and i think the first The Smurfs is really good, and entertaining for adults too....This one is just too much....Too much Smurfs for sure.....Stick with the first one!!!!!!"
"OR";"These are really good trouser hangers.  And, the price was good for the 4-pack.  Definitely would get more
if needed.  I hang the pants at the bottom of the leg section and they hold them nicely and wrinkle-free."
"OR";"Brush works well but I wish it had a cap to keep dirt out of it when in storage. Smudge tip works pretty well too. Looks cheap but feels well made."
"OR";"great movie '' i don't know art but i know what i like '' please forgive me but this is a great movie enough nudity and a story line great buy"
"OR";"Only problem with Dickies work pants is fading. Having posted that comment, I will continue to purchase Dickies.  Well sewn, strong, good zipper, easy to iron and crease hold up well."
"OR";"My daughter loves scratch art, but because she's five, she woild make one small picture on the big sheets and waste the rest. These were perfect, because it's so much less wasteful.....and expensive.  I will buy them again when she runs out."
"OR";"Fun little fish sink quickly and are nice and bright so you can see them clearly from a good distance.  very good size/shape for smaller hands who of kids who are working on their diving skills."
"OR";"This is a must have for any kitchen. I had my previous splatter screen for so long and one day the screen just fell out. I saw this 3-Pack and just had to have it. The product is lightweight, good quality, and protects very well. Also a good value."
"OR";"My small dog loves this toy. He has not destroyed it, but the squeaker gave out quickly. He plays with it with great enthusiasm and seems to be happy ""jawing"" it as it does not squeak, but still makes a satisfying sound for my little dog. ~Mary B."
"OR";"My favorite game of all time!  This game is so much fun for adults and kids alike. Some of the younger kids might need a little help but most of them were able to do just fine. You can even always make sure kids get the villager card. I strongly recommend watching a demonstration on youtube on how t"
"OR";"Awesome product well built and worth the the finish is perfect for helping to keep a good grip so far I really enjoy the kettlebud and will be purchasing another in the near future to have one for each hand!!"
"OR";"I wanted a good sturdy slip cover to protect my chairs from kids.  These do that job well.  They get dirty, but they are easy to take on and off and wash up in the washing machine really well.  I'd buy them again."
"OR";"I bought the junior size for my 7yo (she is 70th% for height and weight) and the wrist guards were way too small. I think the junior size fits size 4-6yo. Hopefully the smalls fit"
"OR";"I really love these curtains!  They really tied everything together in the living space of my new cabin in the woods.  The material is very soft and hangs nicely.  I would definitely buy again!"
"OR";"I love this keyboard! The different colors available and the easy to use light level finger spin knob is great. Key response is nice, solid construction, GREAT price!

Totally satisfied!"
"OR";"this is a good movie, as described.  great price which made it worth the buy (in a digital age, physical discs aren't always worth the price). Happy overall."
"OR";"this arrived quickly.  packed well.  exactly what i needed @ a great price.  highly recommend.  would buy this item again.  the best steamer insert i have ever bought."
"OR";"Not sure what the critics are talking about because I like this movie. Moves fast good story line but it is a lot like another movie I have.  I just like Tatum Channing."
"OR";"It's a little bulky, but it is great in protecting the Kindle Fire.  I love the fact that you can easily rotate the kindle and use the case as a stand.  The magnetic closure is fantastic and makes the product easy to use."
"OR";"I love love this bag it is exactly what I needed my wallet fits and it's a pretty big, all along with my sunglasses, keys and my new galaxy s5 and still have extra room, I should also mention that it arrived fast."
"OR";"Again, another great piece in the series. This one is full of political intrigue and conspiracy. It also shows the price you pay for fame. Excellent work. Hang in there true believers."
"OR";"Cool hand saw. Very well made and very sharp. The handles on this make it so easy to work. The hand saw comes in a nylon case for storage or to carry with you. I received this at a discounted price for my review."
"OR";"4.5 stars
It's been a while since a book kept me up all night. This one did.
I absolutely loved the story and the characters.
The editing was good.

The only problem with this book is the cover.
That photo has been used on over 6 other books. A new cover is in order. The story deserves it!!!"
"OR";"Good product overall, fair price. The ball has a strange smell  to it that has not gone away even after several months . It is somewhat hard to get it really clean as well."
"OR";"Priceless... a must have for little hands.  Watching my daughter try to play Go Fish was comical at best, lol.  With this, she can keep track of her cards better.  If you play games with your child, just buy it!"
"OR";"We have even used these art smocks as a bib with messy foods and they work great!! It says you must hand wash and we were initially dismayed by this BUT it is easy to get stuff out of these by rinsing in the sink, so no problem"
"OR";"Great price for this combination.  It comes with a hard plastic shield along with the mesh but I found I like the mesh better because it allows air flow and keeps my face from getting too hot."
"OR";"Love these shoes.  I am going to wear these for our granddaughter's wedding so am wearing them around the house to be sure they will be comfortable..  So far, I can say they are very comfortable and will be perfect with my dress.  Very stylish..  I think they look more expense.."
"OR";"Great toy that my cat loves to play with!  Lots of variety and he can't get enough of playing with the fowl feather.  Product arrived on time and as described.  Great seller who cares about the satisfaction of his customers."
"OR";"Ordered this for my mother-in-law who has very small wrists and and needed something that was easy to put on. Was exactly what she wanted which was something very simple but feminine.

Great product great price."
"OR";"Love it!!!! This skirt is amazing I'm 5 ft 6in and 220 LB and ordered a XL fit perfectly love it I think I will buy another colour and super cheap!"
"OR";"Very cute and great for little hands. The picture makes them look like colored rocks but when they arrive they look globs of wax. But who cares, they're kids crayons that get rubbed away to nothing."
"OR";"I love Honey Do products!  I love this over the door shoe holder. I have four of them. Perfect way to organize shoes and keep them off the floor of your closet. I can't live without them"
"OR";"How much do I love Samsung SSDs? Too much, probably. Great price for when you want that insane improvement in all things speed. Use this as a boot drive and put all your data on a 7200RPM HDD."
"OR";"Anna Pigeon is a jack of all trades. Not only is she a park ranger with law enforcement training, but she's also an emergency medical technician and a trained firefighter. One wonders a bit how much time it took her to obtain all that training, and whether that's the norm for National Park employees"
"OR";"I really enjoyed this book. It is written in the ""gumshoe"" detective"" style. It is easy to see the characters as the story unfolds. The book also makes sense from a ""common sense"" and ""human nature"" perspective."
"OR";"I bought this for an off-white skater skirt my daughter bought that was very thin once we saw it in the full light. This provided the needed coverage to allow her to wear it. The material is nice and has held up for several washings now."
"OR";"I really like these glasses, I will probably buy another pair in the future. I really like the square frames, I would like the squares to be smaller though, because I have a small face."
"OR";"I bought this for my 8 year old for Christmas. He really had a great time building it with his dad and loves flinging things all over the house. He also had a great time painting his!"
"OR";"Unfortunately this particular unit did not work in our walkies.  I'm putting at ""I Like It"" as it wasn't that it would work just the stems on the plug were too long for the particular motorola we use at work so I had to return."
"OR";"My young dogs LOVE these. They have saved countless pairs of shoes and are worth every cent. I rarely find my dogs sitting around without one or two in their reach."
"OR";"Great idea! I'm still in the process of teaching my 6 month old schnoodles to use this to go out. They're still getting used to it but we use it every time we go outside."
"OR";"I normally love Sketchers shoes.  But these were deceiving.  They were made with imitation leather that looked like rubber and they were a bit big they were very wide at the front.
But they were probably they softest shoes I ever tried on, I wasn't surprised by that."
"OR";"Loved the movie -- first I thought oh no another cheap stupid movie that teaches stealing, lying, being mean for fun.

Then got hooked. It's a very well done movie."
"OR";"Love this product great for big Legos or baseplate or long bricks but would not put anything small in it because there is a gap around the bottoms that the lil Legos can fall in . But they do hold a lot"
"OR";"What can I say it works as needed, usually last around 3 hours of full use on a battery only.  For the price you can't beat the battery.  It fit perfectly as well."
"OR";"Bigbox store wanted 4 times as much for a shorter cable,
use it daily plug/ unplug, roll it up throw it in my laptop case, don't treat it very well and it still works!"
"OR";"Bought this for my mom's morning walks and she uses it everyday and likes it!  I am happy she is making use of the pouch belt. She can fit her iPhone 7 plus in one of the pockets which was pretty cool."
"OR";"Sweet Love Story!

I enjoyed this story although it was too short.  The author drew the reader in and allowed us to experience the emotions of her characters.  The story was just a clean sweet romance story."
"OR";"I purchased these to go with my new bedding set.  These throw pillow covers are awesome.  So whimsical.  I just love them.  They are made out of high quality material and it seems they will hold up to daily use.  I am very happy I purchased these.  Cute, cute...."
"OR";"I am sad to sad i was so disappointed in this very, very short story. It was way short and it felt like you started the story in the middle and then it ended abruptly. I love Joyce work and will read more of hers in the future, but this is not worth the 99 cents."
"OR";"Got this 4 days ago, so far so good. I bought this for my husband who has developed allergies in the last year. We have two long haired cats and a 85 pound Lab. His allergies were so bad last week he woke up short of breath and couldn't sleep. I let this run on high for 6 hours the first day, then s"
"OR";"Love this peeler.  I had purchased one a few years ago and somehow it got lost.  I tried to replace it with other brands and they just didn't do the job as well.  This time I purchased two just in case.  Would recommend it to everyone."
"OR";"Wow Sarah Grimm has done it again. A great love story. I have waited for this book ever since I read After Midnight. The story about Is a and Noah. Sarah is one of my favorite Authors."
"OR";"Replaced a 14 YO little giant with this model.  1/2 the price and greater HP.  Works great and does what it needs to do efficiently.  Shipped quick, packed well"
"OR";"I use this tool constantly at work. I have seen a lot of electricians at work break off screwdrivers to make there own tool like this. Im glad they make a better tool then to break a good tool."
"OR";"One of my favorite trilogies ever! Great characters and an amazing story! You'll love Mia and Adam as they work through their struggles and triumphs! Awesome books!"
"OR";"Bought one of these on a recommendation.  They really work well for hiking with the dogs.  Nice size for them to use but collapsible and nice small size for storage."
"OR";"My son loves it. This has kept my son busy for many, many hours. he loves hammering the nails into the holes and pulling them back out. It is a good product to keep them entertained and developing motor skills."
"OR";"My dog loves this toy - this is her second one. She treats it like her baby and carries it around the house in her mouth. The first one is still fine after almost 2 years, I just bought a second one for travel."
"OR";"This was my first Sawyer novel and I absolutely loved it! I loved how different it was, how intrigued it kept me, and how much I loved the characters. I can't wait for the novella to come out next month."
"OR";"So many secrets revealed.  Through it all, the love is still apparent.  This Friessen family is by no means perfect, but they love hard and protect what's theirs.  This has been a wonderful series and I can't wait to read more about this family."
"OR";"I wasn't sure I'd like this audio book - I bought it for my husband who is a big Baldacci fan of his espionage and intrigue - not my genre - but it was a GREAT story.  The vendor sent it quickly and in perfect condition."
"OR";"I ready likes the characters in the book.  I am really impressed with Debra Burroughs.  I have put several of her books on my wish list.
She kept me interested throughout the whole book."
"OR";"I was somewhat hesitant to read this book because I feared the language used by the author would be too distracting.  However, the story itself is so engrossing that my worries were needless (and undoubtedly the language itself is necessary to create the unique voice of Saba).  This novel is about S"
"OR";"I enjoyed this werewolf story. The heroine is a wonderful character and her son's are sure to be strong characters in future books. The hero is a well rounded character as well and I look forward to reading about how he handles all the twists headed his way."
"OR";"Works really well.  My wrist and fore arm where getting achy with my normal mouse. This really helped.  Takes a little while to get used to the upright grip but worth it."
"OR";"well made. works good. came in a timely manner. not too hard to install, and its great for keeping your heat in the house cause you're not opening the door as much for in and out."
"OR";"This is so much fun for the money!  Works great and is hours and hours of fun. I'm getting another one so 5 or more can have a MLP party on rainy summer days."
"OR";"Fantastic product.  A lot of complaints about wrinkles, but I have never opened a fabric item package and have it come out looking ironed.  You will have to iron creases.  Very good quality.  I would buy again."
"OR";"I think this is the best Plum story yet.  A lot of insight to the background of Ranger, great interaction between all of the characters a little added drama, and....FUNNY, as usual.  Good job Ms Evanovich"
"OR";"Bought the 36"" version.  In my experience, product is excellent and shipping was reasonably quick.  Product seems robust to me, and easy to install the light fixtures.  No issues, would buy again."
"OR";"It's a long read but it's so gripping you'll fly through pretty fast. The characters of the town is what makes this such a good book. You'll be feeling for them all by the end. Just like with all of King's books there is some graphic content but for adults it shouldn't be a problem."
"OR";"Ondaatje's books are always well-written and a pleasure to read. However, I didn't LIVE The Cat's Table. When a book remains part of my consciousness long after I finish it, then I rave to my friends and family about it."
"OR";"My 6 year-old daughter wanted to be a chicken for Halloween. Okay...... I found this costume and it is pretty good quality. She now wears it for dress-up. It makes all of us laugh. I am glad we got it."
"OR";"My son wears size 18 month clothing, and size 5.5 shoe and we bought the 2T-3T.  They fit good, but are pretty tight on the ankle.  They are also a lot thinner than I was expecting, so not super great for winter."
"OR";"Could not put this book down. Well the IPad anyways. I love this author's writing style. She really captures my attention. I am looking forward to reading the last book in this trilogy. OR maybe we will get more of Colton in a 4th."
"OR";"Our family loves all of the Arthur and D.W. stories, and this book seems to have particular resonance at this time, as two of my three kids are picky eaters. My four-year-old, my three-year-old, and my two-year-old all like to hear this story over and over again."
"OR";"LIKE ALL JAMES PATTERSON BOOKS THIS KEPT THE STORY MOVING AND HAD A TWIST I WASNT SUSPECTING TILL RIGHT TO THE END. GOOD STORY LINE READ IT RIGHT THROUGH."
"OR";"Thunderball feels like the first three early bond films somehow rolled perfectly, cohesively, and successfully into one new original and spectacular film. The movie overall seems balanced with its drama, action, story, and other elements. So it feels like the ultimate Bond movie (Peter Hunt's 'On He"
"OR";"Gorgeous dress! I LOVE the sequins and the fit.  It was delivered really quickly.  I ordered it in ""gold"" which is more of a rose gold, but it's stunning.  And I liked it so well that I've ordered another one in green."
"OR";"We love this -- it's the second one we ordered.  We feed several outside cats, and we never have any more problems with ants getting in their food.  I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"OR";"I love it.  used it  skiing n Utah, snowing.  looks great.  also white pants.  perfectly fitted.  Elegant.  Very ultra warm.  Heading to Canada with these very low degrees......."
"OR";"great movie, great action!!!!! asian movies are really good, even with subtitles.best buy of a new movie in the last 2 years"
"OR";"I use this to check my carpet after cleaning to see when it's time to remove the fans. I love it! It seems to be very accurate and is easy to use. I would definitely buy this again."
"OR";"Both my dogs loved this treat! One of my dogs devoured this whole treat in about two minutes. My other dog savored it for a bit longer, but still didn't last quite as long as expected. One thing is for sure, they both definitely enjoyed it. One thing that is a bit confusing about this treat is that "
"OR";"I enjoy this author and I particularly like the light hearted Chrstmas stories.  THey add to the happiness of Christmas and take one away from the bussel and hecticness of ones presnt duties."
"OR";"I really liked this, even though the protagonist was very unlikeable.  The plot was good, realistic and had a lot of character aspects, so it was unclear and shaded by different character's viewpoints.  Excellent in my book."
"OR";"Tiffany Green's second book in the Secrets and Scandals series was a delightful story to read with several twists and turns to keep our interest. I am looking forward to the next in the series"
"OR";"I love this movie so much it hurts. Full disclosure, you have to love the type of comedy like Black Dynamite or Tim and Eric or it won't be for you. Half the people will love this film, half will hate it."
"OR";"Love the swimming hat. Have used it in salt water, pool, and have washed it numerous occasions. Has kept its bright  color true to size. Not bulky or flimsy. Just right, love it!"
"OR";"I enjoyed reading this book. This novel is entertaining, moving and funny. The author grabbed me from the first chapter and I was laughing really hard sometimes. Very well written novel, looking forward to read more by this author."
"OR";"I didn't like this book at all. I just don't like this authors writing style and choice of words. No Kristin Hannah and that's for sure! Can't hold a candle to ""The Nightingale."" I should know by now to be Leary of first books."
"OR";"Strange and slow start...but ending up being a pretty good movie. Would give it five stars but not everyone enjoys obscenities. Still, one of the best ""out of the box"" movies on prime. Kudos to to cast."
"OR";"Terrific and easy to use thermostat. I really like the touch screen functions. Very easy to set up and use and change if needed. Has worked flawlessly for several years."
"OR";"Zoe Michaels lives with her boyfriend, Chase Hilliard, and their two best friends, Brody McNamara and Tate Winslow. Zoe and Chase have an extraordinary sex life and often shared their most sensual sexual fantasies at night. After Zoe creates one of Chase's fantasies for his birthday, he decides to r"
"OR";"I love this brand as they don't have any tags or seams to irritate your skin.  The new fabric that they use is nice, but the adhesive pantie liners that you buy does not stick well to it, so they often come loose."
"OR";"If you enjoy reading the world of Harmony this won't be an exception.  I've enjoyed these books and realized along the way I missed this one.  This is a short story, set pretty early in the series.  Virginia is a para-archeologist and Sam is a ghost hunter.  They have decided to merge their business"
"OR";"I gave this product 3 stars only because I feel that it is very well made however, for me it was not a good choice because it is just too bulky to carry around. It will protect the flashlight and if you don't mind the size, it is worth the money."
"OR";"These are the best baby hats - we have one in every size and my second child has gone through most of them now as well.  They're still good as new and hold up well to washing."
"OR";"These are such great tags!  I will say, though, that the black has a tendancy to wear off faster than the other colors. I do dog rescue so have purchased many of these. And to date, this company has never made a typo on any of them. which I find to be amazing."
"OR";"This is the one you I can say I got my money's worth. My son plays with it alllllll day long. He loves it. The neighbor kids love it. Everyone thinks it's cool."
"OR";"The last few books by Lynda Chance have left me feeling disappointed and a little cheated. This book wasn't to bad though and I am talking about the intensity between Garrett and Maria. I liked this one, I think she's back!!!!!"
"OR";"I order these for a shower as they came up in my search.  Unfortunately they were far too short to be able to use.  The metal was durable and the finish was perfect.  We returned the item since it wasn't going to work for our needs"
"OR";"Too small for anything useful.  I wanted to use one to cover the camera on my computers but they're too small! I'm sorry I bought them, but since they were so cheap,  I won't bother to return them."
"OR";"I put this on a brick wall over my fireplace, next to a painting of a Autumnal forest that is mostly red. Looks great. The clock is silent, keeps perfect time and is easy to read. I really am glad I got it."
"OR";"by far the best case i ever owned. it keeps every thing cool, it looks nice and its easy to manage cables. this case or one like it is a must have."
"OR";"I've been looking for this movie, at last I owned it now on DVD.
I received this today.  Right now I'm watching it here in my PC.
And later when I get home , I'll play this on my player. Watch it all over again."
"OR";"One of my serious all-time favorite movies. Good every couple years. LOVE Jeff Bridges, and the goofy humor, makes me laugh every time."
"OR";"words cannot describe this anime, I watched it in Japanese first ages ago and I just had to have it. Have watched another 5 times and still cannot get over it. this show has been ratted one of the best and it is for a reason, I highly recommend it."
"OR";"We have purchased many of Melissa and Doug products before. I like how they not only teach but also entertain. I bought this for my niece but my four year old nephew also loves helping his sister stack them up."
"OR";"I ordered this either for my wife and I or as a gift if you look at the rating we gave it that will tell you if we liked it or not, if it is special we will add a little comment same if it is bad. But telling me how many word I need to use is STUPID !!"
"OR";"Nice quick read with interesting story and plot. Heroine was strong and assertive. Hero was a little more flawed. Good romantic episodes. Would read this author again."
"OR";"This car is awesome! My son loves it and drives it all over the front room, he has crashed it a couple times and the only thing that has happened is a little paint scuff, the body still intact and everything! We love this car"
"OR";"would have like to no if they got lucky at the end I've got dogs and I love them I'm very sick person my dogs are by my side all the time so this was close to my heart"
"OR";"Emilie du Chatelet was a most interesting women for her time, or for any time. A member of the French aristocracy she was adored by her father and taught unwomanly things like sword fighting, riding, languages, literature and mathematics. She also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the harp"
"OR";"Great book. Great pics. Good size. Reading this as a yearly tradition and writing in the front where,  and with whom we spent Christmas and read the book with."
"OR";"The story becomes better the more the author writes.  Very entertaining, very good character development knows how to have the situations seem believable even in outer space.  If we ever get into our galaxy there will be good and bad just like in this story."
"OR";"These work but not super easy to use and it may take more than a few to get the job done so on a dollar cost basis the are not very cheap. I can see the utility of them but I could also just see using a chamber brush too."
"OR";"great for the price even came in a back pack type bag . my 4 yr old loved it , we live in phoenix and its nice and thin so, don't get if u live in cold weather."
"OR";"A really great book. The characters are awesome. The love story is exciting and the suspense is killing me. I can't wait to see what happens in Romania and New York."
"OR";"I liked this book, but it is very short.  I would recommend planning on reading the second book right after for a more complete book experience.  I am very excited to read more in this series."
"OR";"Fun and really stimulates the mind. Don't have much to say other than it's a cube that can be solved and works like how it is supposed to. Some of the stickers are a little off center. I'm a little picky about that. I'm debating on getting a 5x5x5"
"OR";"I cut this device a lot a slack in terms of criticism because it was so inexpensive (under $40).  It works as described and, with a little tedious fine tuning, it delivers a pretty clear picture.
But, it could be a lot better.  The camera lens zoom and focus is pre-set and not adjustable.  The only "
"OR";"Great food, one of my favorites for my goldfish and other omnivorous fish. Works great on a clip, or just soak and dump in the tank. I have also found it works great in gel food for added nutrition and fiber."
"OR";"I am a professional  haircolorist and obviously stand on my feet. These are nice looking, lighter weight than you expect and will save your feet .Many of my clients have bought them also and they come in lots of colors.."
"OR";"If you want loud clear clean sound these speakers will shred your hearing. They are amazing and don't cost a lot. They look great in my car and blow my head off. Very happy great job Rockford!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"OR";"These are great Yeti knockoffs at a fraction of the price! Bonus two lids and two straws! This is my new go to gift! I order monogramed initials and put them on......voila.......the recipients love 'em"
"OR";"terrible. cheapest of the cheapest and looks like it came from the dollar tree. The advertised picture makes it look nice and firm but its flat and made of a flimsy plastic. did not use it at all"
"OR";"I bought one of these at IKEA for my cube at work. It does an excellent job of reducing the light level and making it easier to read.

The only complaint is that it can be tricky to find the entrance to the pole sleeves."
"OR";"Honestly, these are the best things for organization and packing light.  I love them!!  I have shown them to everyone I know that travels.  They are especially good if you are on the move because you can get out only what you need for the night and pack quickly the next day."
"OR";"It was a good book in that  each chapter was story that could stand alone.  I was very busy and I could read it at a slow pace a chapter or two at a time.  I was a little disapointed that at yhe ending."
"OR";"Great harness - exactly what we needed to reign in an energetic doxie mix!  Easy to fit to her size, and it works perfectly to have a textbook walk with our little girl!"
"OR";"One of the most important American plays has never looked so good in print. This is an immaculate copy of the play script. It is easy to read and the words are fairly good sized compared to the amount of text present."
"OR";"Easy to set up and easy to use. I watch my dog all day from work on my iPad or my iPhone. I have two and will be buying a 3rd. If you ever want to change locations just plug it in somewhere else in your house."
"OR";"This was one of the best mc reads and I read at least 6 novels a week was always on edge not knowing what's around the corner... Definite recommend reads can't wait for another"
"OR";"Though sometimes the translation is a bit awkward, the story is great. I only hope that the conclusion I've reached about the final book is not correct!
Rebekkah is a real treat.....hoping to see that she lives on in another series!"
"OR";"Good price, and I looked around, great buy, works great........really helped clear the water. Last a long time too. God buy."
"OR";"gets you from the start, If you've read gone girl and liked that you will love this as well. it's got great characters and the plot is super thick. Libby is a great main character with a creep feel. the whole book is great -- read it!"
"OR";"Bought this for my grandson who loves wrestling and collecting wrestling and memorabilia.  Made well and a good price.  Even with rough play it still withstands the kids playing"
"OR";"I got these at a discount for my honest review. These come in handy for cleaning your screen on your electronics. They are not real big, so I also carry a couple in my purse to clean my glasses  They work well."
"OR";"I have been using this Pro home pet grooming kit for a while now. My old one broke so I purchased a new one. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to do home grooming of their animals."
"OR";"Warning, very, very small pieces. This is a wonderful little playset and we are major fans of the Magiclip princesses. My three year old changes their clothes with zero problem and loves their little 'houses'."
"OR";"I purchased this because i misplaced my higher end grooming set when we moved.
It works as expected but it's also incredibly loud, vibrates much more than our old said and our dog is terrified.
It will do the job though."
"OR";"The folks at Belkin make quality products, and this case is great companion for the Kindle Fire HD 7"".
Really great of you are watching a movie or TV show.
Recommended."
"OR";"I loved this book. I bought it this afternoon and couldn't put it down. My only complaint is I want more. I like how this book is focused more on story content instead of extremely long and raunchy sex scenes which are over done in a lot of current fiction."
"OR";"I liked this book with its series of stories about mail order brides.  It was set in the time of cowboys, a time I enjoy.  Recommend this for an easy, light read."
"OR";"It ended very abruptly. I was really enjoying the book and then it just ends. So much was left unanswered and it was just disappointing. It built to this great ending but stopped short. I would have liked there to have been something more."
"OR";"This knife comes super sharp and with a very nice boot sheath. My one complaint would be that the handle is very small if you have large or average hands you will most likely find it a little too slender."
"OR";"I was excited to give these virtual reality glasses a try. I have to admit that I have really enjoyed these virtual reality glasses since I received them. I have downloaded several apps just to get a feel for the glasses and have had a blast riding roller coasters and visiting spooky houses. The vir"
"OR";"Wow i can't believe Richards left me hanging near the end. But this has to be on my top 5. Lies, love, betrayal, this book has it all and I can't wait to read the third book."
"OR";"So this works great if your hamster actually decides to use it as potty litter. My little hamster, Darwin, enjoys to roll around in it. Every night I'd hear the balls shuffle around."
"OR";"I have always loved this movie and what it stood for. The only thing I did not like was all the cursing I didn't realize from watching it on regular tv but still a good heart warming movie of triumph."
"OR";"My cat is quite used to me clipping her claws. I had no problem putting these on her. But I do recommend the clear ones as another poster said. It's easier to see how much glue you put in there."
"OR";"It is pretty much what I expected, like anything new I am getting used to it.  Is is pretty easy to set up and I believe it will meet my expectations. The size of display is just fine, and I appreciate the moon phases, have not seen this before."
"OR";"The product is just as described and sturdily made, but if I wanted another one I'd definitely buy it at a store.  Amazon shipped this small package in a box that measured about 20x14x12.  I can't think of any reason to be so wasteful."
"OR";"This girl is one of the best belly dance teachers you will ever find- absolutely gorgeous. She really knows her stuff and can make a world of difference for good in your dancing. Buy it! You won't be dissapointed!"
"OR";"I assembled it with my kids this weekend and you had a lot of fun. Not only it's really easy to build (not so many parts, that come organized in different bags, easy instructions), the result is a beautiful, well-constructed toy that you can actually play with!"
"OR";"Harder to follow than the book. You start in the middle of the story with no idea as to what is going on unless you read the book which was very pedestrian. Neither the book nor the movie is worth your time."
"OR";"I do not like to wear under ware so taught I would purchase these and pray they are comfortable, well they are most certainly comfortable to the point you forget you have them on.  I am curvy and they fit me perfect.  I will be buying more in the different styles"
"OR";"I have seen the book around for a while and did not read it because it was a book about a video game. My mistake. Ready Player One is a great story. Keeps you involved and entertained all the way through. Just a fun, exciting, and entertaining read. Highly recommend it for all ages."
"OR";"This swimsuit is super cute!!! It looks just like the picture. I was worried about the bottoms not fitting as i am larger on the bottom and small on the top, so i ordered a large. The large still fit a little snug and the top was perfect for my size."
"OR";"Gave to my grandson who turned 6.  Had to have help putting it together...but he loved playing with it.  Was smaller in size than we thought it would be...but still loved it!"
"OR";"They got to us quick and free of damage and beautiful. They make an artistic splash of red in her kitchen and work well too. No leaking from either stoppers. Very ergonomic as well."
"OR";"Item shipped on time and was as described. Excellent customer service. This product works great and is what I needed. My old cord for my external hard drive, the wires were sticking out had to replace it with this one. I highly recommend this product."
"OR";"I'll admit, it was the mention of a unicorn that attracted me to WARPED, so I was totally unprepared for the epic storyline that I discovered within the covers of this debut novel.

After reading just a few pages of WARPED, in which the Fates examine and manipulate the threads of life they rule over"
"OR";"I decided to try this style as a change.  My mistake.  After a month of wearing them, I've found the button fly is difficult to unbutton and re-button.  Otherwise, the pants fit well and wear well."
"OR";"As always, Chet & Bernie deliver a page turner.  Just love how Chet keeps the story moving.  If you have a dog or are a dog lover, this series is for you.  You just might see some of Chet in your dog :)"
"OR";"My daughter,15, and I watched this together and I really did like the music. The only problem was that it could have included a bit more of the 80's music. But still in all it was cute and we sang through the story along with the actors, so it was worth the watch."
"OR";"This is a great movie - sub titles, but the acting is excellent.  My family really loved it and I've watched it several times.  Originally saw it at a movie theater in Santa Barbara, Ca."
"OR";"My favorite out of the 1, 2 and 4 led lights.  These things are great.  Battery life is unexpectedly great.  It has lasted on its first batteries (3D's i believe) for over 5 months of moderate use"
"OR";"This wall deco was a perfect touch as it helped transform the room for our daughters minnie mouse themed 1st birthday. Great buy and highly recommend! I will probably keep it to put in her room."
"OR";"This product claims to be a large bowl but I can't even fit my fist into it, my bulldog could use this as a muzzle.  It's picturesd with a Lab dog my dog is smaller than most Lab dogs."
"OR";"Very good product for the money. At first the ""clamps"" that create the friction keeping the pole from telecoping in can move around a bit. I used a little bit of duct tape to keep the clamp from sliding down."
"OR";"Well-made level.  I don't know where it was manufactured, but it seems sturdily built.  Price line is good.  I gave it to my son for part of his birthday gift.  I'd buy another. . . and probably will. . ."
"OR";"Very sturdy I have a 7 lb dog and he goes up and down no problem also I have a wood floor and it doesn't move around whenhe goes up and down. Easy to put together also don't need any tools."
"OR";"Works straight out of box on default settings with first fan in my house. Change one dipswitch and it worked with the other one. Great replacement fan remote. I have circa 2000 fans and it still works."
"OR";"Well wouldn't you know it, another good read by one of my new favorite authors. I have read several books by Chet Cunningham and will look forward to more."
"OR";"Loved these shoes. The reviews for these shoes made me purchase them and they were all true. Theyre soft. Nice heal. Made well. And the 2 inch heel is comfy. I would definetly purchase these shoes again in other colors."
"OR";"These are the only pants I buy for work. I have been wearing these exact style of pants for 12 years. Yes I go through about 4 pair a year but nothing else would ever hold up at this price."
"OR";"All I can say is please don't let the story die - so many possibilities for all of the characters - A well written and exciting read on so many levels - histoically and romantically with fantasy thrown in for good measure"
"OR";"I have to rotate cat food now that my cats are more than 15 years old.  They like to change every 7 - 10 days, so I keep three different kinds on hand.  This is one of their favorites."
"OR";"Got it for my 3 yr old nephew. He loves bugs and these weren't too creepy and the colors were fun and he could learn the type of bugs they are. Great sizes too.. I was worried they would be too small. They were perfect."
"OR";"Makes reloading smoother. I've tried other reloaders. This one is very good because its basic. You just push down on the spring and slide in your round with your thumb. Takes a few times to speedload but once you get the flow your good."
"OR";"Love it, I keep it in my camping bag, it's really a good hatchet, good balance, good handle feel, holding an edge well so far."
"OR";"Just bought a couple more as back ups.  I really like this remote and it works well for what I need it for.  I emailed Audiovox and they confirmed that this is the exact same remote as the RCR314WR but this one costs less."
"OR";"Look good fit fine. Color and finish look good. Heavy quality. Sound like a rain storm when the air blows through them, a little loud."
"OR";"I use this treat for training my 5 months puppy. He loves it. Only A first few time he ate this treat, his stool got a little soft. I guess his tummy was adjusting to the new food."
"OR";"These are awesome!  I had a curl on one corner of my large rug that was gone immediately after putting these on.  I used ruggies for a long time and they didn't work at all.  If you have any doubts, get these!"
"OR";"Excellent read - was difficult to put it down. There are so many incredible thoughts in this book - it is marked, highlighted, and written all over. Every time I read through a passage I find something new to thinnk about."
"OR";"my mini american eskie loves this cube! it takes some work on his part to shake all the kibble out. I like the fact it takes longer than 10 seconds and all the treats are out. Really keeps him busy and its a game for him!"
"OR";"I like the plot, I enjoyed the book. The characters are likable and I understood why the female lead acted the way she did because of past hurts. The books was a good length and the ending was satisfying."
"OR";"Very interesting and well written book.  Good plot and interesting characters.  The story held my interest and attention
right till the end.  I give it my highest recommendation."
"OR";"I absolutely love the collar! The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars was it does loosen like other reviews stated. I use a harness however, when walking my dog, so it's just an accessory anyway."
"OR";"i was happy i bought this its cheaper in the long run if you were renting one from charter like i was. I'm very happy with this one it has never went bad or done anything stupid like kick us off the internet."
"OR";"The Chase was a very enjoyable, fast paced story.  Moves along like a screenplay / movie, aka good summer read.  Found it a very good second chapter to the Heist of last year."
"OR";"Great bag.  I've been using it for a month to haul purse/lunch/laptop back and forth to work, and it is rolling smootly and holding up fine.  Laptop pocket is padded well, overall capacity of the backpack is good."
"OR";"this particular one i had to send back because it was the wrong one. i needed it for Nikon. but this works perfect. make sure it says 1/8000 sync . because there is a 1/250 that does not work past 1/250"
"OR";"Arrived quickly and easy to install.  They work great.  Nice being able to leave the house for a walk or bike ride and not have to carry a key.
Schlage is a great product."
"OR";"Good lego set. The box came damaged but all the parts were present and it was fun to build with my son. Highly recommended for anyone with kids who like the avengers and/or Iron Man!"
"OR";"It is wonderful to be able to get the amount of the dog food I want in the flavor my dog loves and delivered for a better value then the store I shop at which never seems to have what I need or has only one or two cans at the most.  Thank you for being there for us!"
"OR";"I have not read the first book so that might have made a difference to how I saw this book. It was very hard for me to get into the book but I kept going as it was gifted to me and I wanted to read it to the end to give an honest review. I do plan to go and get book one and then re-read this book af"
"OR";"Used them for the first time today.  Great after using a bore brush to clean out the chamber area.  The only problem I have is the price.  Hopefully they will figure out a way to reduce it in the near future."
"OR";"Facinating comparion of two warriors.  It was easy to read and gave me a much better incite into the thinking of the Indians of the 19th century. I would highly recommend this book."
"OR";"Had to buy 2 and cut to fit since we have a four-foot shower. It doesn't work that well but it's passable. Doesn't anybody make what's needed for these larger showers."
"OR";"Works great use it mostly to get excess water off of my pool cover in the off season and it works really well. I would recommend this pump"
"OR";"I received an ARC of this book and it is the first I read from this author. It was alright. I thought it had its moments but just not something I would read again or really suggest unless someone wanted a quick read."
"OR";"love the pants;;;;;great fit ,and great look,great price. they were comfortable through out my work out and I love the colors. I ordered myself another pair liked so much;;;;;;"
"OR";"Another Great Weldon Brothers series. It was great how Nan was able to get Jackson to not give up on his life. I enjoyed their story and how things turned out for the two of them and the bundle of joy that they had. I will be recommending the book to my family and friends to read."
"OR";"I love this steamer and was ready to rate it 5 stars but it broke on me (last time I used it was a few months ago so I'm not sure what happened). I am disappointed that it didn't last me longer than 2 years."
"OR";"Great read!  I read about 3 books a week and this one was memorable.  Relationship between the main characters is fun and entertaining.  I recommend it!  Good writer!"
"OR";"Very comfortable sandals.  Arch support is not an issue for this particular shoe.  This is actually my 3rd pair this year (different colors).  It's always nice to find comfortable footwear for hard to fit feet."
"OR";"I really enjoyed this book.  It was surprising, deep, interesting, humorous and encouraging.  At first it seems like a darker read, but by the end of the book, I was smiling and reading this book made me happy.  I would recommend it for any age adult."
"OR";"My husband was so excited when we got this in.  He tried it out on all of our kitchen knives and he says they work very well.  It's a bit time consuming to sharpen but the stone works better than our previous sharping utensil."
"OR";"It's a nice comfy bed. The height seems ok. I wish it was a little bigger. My 8lb pooch barely fits in there. Probably will be great toy dogs or cats."
"OR";"Great product for lighting safe path/s of egress after hours,,"" It's Goldilocks "" not to bright or to dim, mounted in hall @ 14"" and lights foot traffic perfect, will be looking for more for other areas of travel in the house,,"
"OR";"Very nice product.  Was very easy to add strip LED lighting and create professional looking enclosed LED shelf lighting.  The angle helps direct the light in and it looks great."
"OR";"I liked the book very much, read it on a trip, but I did NOT like the fact that it left me at a cliff hanger and I had to wait until I got back home to get the second book. As a published author, I would never do that to my readers"
"OR";"Door broke off constantly, at first it was easy to pop back on but now I can't get it on anymore.  Otherwise it's pretty good quality, the figures are nice but my son just uses the castle with his angry birds figures"
"OR";"My Cat LOVES this cat scratcher.  This is my second purchase as the first one needed to be replaced (after about a year of use) from constant kitty scratching.  That just means it works :)."
"OR";"This crate has been great for our 3 month old Corgi. He takes up about one-third to one-half of the crate right now, so we have been using the divider. It's great that we will still be able to use this crate when he is full size."
"OR";"I bought these so my toddler can run around on our laminate flooring. I purchased them a size bigger because I was worried the sizing was not accurate. I made the right choice. I don't mind the socks being a little big."
"OR";"All 3 of my cats love this stuff. Seems like a great, simple (and hopefully healthy) treat. It's a bit pricy but well worth it to see how excited the furry babies get when I shake the container."
"OR";"This bra is a little too ""pointy"" & it doesn't fit true to size. It feels stiff & itchy.  I don't think I would buy it again unless I could try it on first."
"OR";"I recieved a copy of this book for a review. It's an amazing story. I like how it's not rushed right into their relationship and how they work to figure it out. It's a great book to curl up with on a snowy day"
"OR";"Really comfortable handles, I installed them on new bike, went for 20 miles ride and loved the handles - really comfortable, excellent grip, and also very good looking."
"OR";"I devoured this series. Well written, the premise of an unknown place in a world of chaos sounds possible in these pages. Characters are so well developed can't wait to see what will happen next."
"OR";"I've had this shape wear for nearly one year.  It probably does run a tad small but it also needs to be snug to do its job.  I am short- 5'2""- and (was) 40ish lbs overweight so I ordered the L.  It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to"
"OR";"I loved this story! I have read all of the transformed series and Gessilyn is a great side character so it was awesome to read her story. As usual Stacy Claflin didn't disappoint."
"OR";"I bought this for my niece which is 11 months old. She loves this and plays with it all the time. It is sturdy as I was worried it would tip over with her just learning to walk. There has been no problems yet. She has had no problems getting on and off and uses it to push and walk also."
"OR";"High quality umbrella with the greatest UNCONQUERED team on it. I bought this right before the Noles' most recent BCS Championship winning season so I'm tempted to get another one again."
"OR";"This powder measure is accurate. Not the greatest quality but for what it cost it good. I will only be using it to work up a new loads. I have a progressive reloader, I like to work up new loads with a single stage press."
"OR";"Really good except the case came with morphed edges almost like it had been melting and the DVD was off the holder so it was sliding around the case. It works great, though."
"OR";"Great movie. The 7.1 puts you into the movie like you are there, like the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. I love when they spend a lot of time perfecting this. The only complant I have is the out takes should have been put back into the movie, It would have made it even better."
"OR";"My dog's ears were just a horrible mess and smelled like rotten____ been using this product for about a week and his ears have changed tremendously for the better will let you know in two more weeks how things are going"
"OR";"I received the product today. My puppy has not played with it for more than 10 seconds, but I don't really think it's the bone's fault so I'm still giving it 4 stars. My dog can be picky with his toys."
"OR";"Beautiful!!! I purchased the silver, and I love it! Excellent quality & price. I washed in the gentle cycle, and the dryer on low heat, to get the wrinkles out. Worked like a charm! 5+ Stars!!!"
"OR";"Amazing!!!! Bring on #3.  I cant get enough of this series. The way you can literally feel their emotions. The easy flow of the words. The tension..the love...the chase. This is one series I will read over and over again."
"OR";"That was a damn good prequel. Probably one of the best I've read in a very long time. I fell in love with the series and the prequel of Forbidden Fruit. You did your thing with this Ms. Nika Michelle."
"OR";"excellent movie nice color and the sound track is great you will just love this movie in blueray thats the only way to watch a very good movie is in blueray."
"OR";"Sunset Hill by Everett Powers is a thriller novel featuring a California police officer named Grant Starr.  In Sunset Hill the Sunset Hill killer is back despite the fact that they had a woman in jail that had confessed to prior crimes.  This is the third book in the Grant Starr series and the first"
"OR";"A little disappointed.  It's quite a typical love story and nothing out of the ordinary for Kate Hudson.  I'm still looking for that spark she first had.
I think I'll donate this one to charity."
"OR";"Nice magnifier for the price.  I looked at 3 brands when shopping.  Eotech , Vortex and Sightmark.  The Eotech is great but it is way out of my price range.  The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The "
"OR";"Worked surprising well. Brighter than the cheap China ones for sure. I'm waiting for the E26 base and I'll replace many more.  They website is a little flaky on getting registered for warranty."
"OR";"Worked well for a few months, but recently has been giving horribly inaccurate readings (half of what it should read).  If there is a way to fix it let me know, otherwise i do not recommend buying this item."
"OR";"Not a very exciting book.  A little bit of suspense, a little bit of romance.i did not care for the way the story was told.  The characters were hardly believable.  Big plus no bad language or steamy sex."
"OR";"Back and better than ever!!! I had both Shrinky Dinks and TMNT Toys as a kid and it's so cool that everything is back for the new generation. What's even better now is that the plastic is pre-cut so there's no sharp plastic edges like before. It's little things like that which make a big difference."
"OR";"A good book.  It's rather dry reading, but seems to be a good overview of machine learning.  I've only used it for supervised learning so far in my grad ML class."
"OR";"Good product but Ive purchased over a dozen of similar led solar lights and they only seem to last approximately one year. Nice while they last but price needs to be reduced for such a short shelf life."
"OR";"Totally enjoyable, well written with some unexpected twist in plot which added to the novel's character. The bonus was even hotter.  Good writing, few errors, easy read."
"OR";"what a  great deal on these.
i used them on my 2  Yongnuo 600 LED lights
they soften them up just like a light soft  box.
they are much cheaper and more compact than buying the  soft boxes that go with these lights."
"OR";"I bought this nd did not use it for 6 months. I used it 5 times a a piece inside broke. Worthless, maybe I just got a lemon.  I have never had any problem with dewalts except for this one."
"OR";"I have switched my dog from a mix of hills science diet and Rachel ray grain free nutrish (salmon)  to this over the past week.  He is a growing Bassett hound, 10 mo;  I know not everyone would consider this a large breed because  he is short, but I know that his breed can get up to 70 pounds full-g"
"OR";"Love this set of clippers. I have used it at least 4 times. It's a great set. Well worth the money I paid and it comes with alot of guards for different hair lengths. Would definitely recommend this product!"
"OR";"Good series, just extremely low volume during speaking parts. It's like the director was afraid that the actors did not know their lines. A little disappointed because I really like Peter Davison."
"OR";"Enjoy this one very much . Understand why men want to claim you and have their cake and eat it to made sense. Want to keep the good girl and play with the others until you are ready for the good girl"
"OR";"If you've watched director David DeCoteau's previous movies (The Brotherhood series, The Frightening, Leeches), then you pretty much know what to expect:

1) buff young studs running around in their underwear for no apparent reason

2) slomo sequences that are so dull and repetitious, and used mainl"
"OR";"Great product.  My only complaint is that if you actually put stuff in each of the pockets, the whole thing is  pretty bulky.  I was hoping for something a bit slimmer, but it is definitely heavy-duty and will last quite a while."
"OR";"Product is no good. Only works 1 time out of 6 uses. Don't buy! It's a piece of crap. Not even going to give it away; throwing it in the trash. I waste of money!"
"OR";"looks great and I love the way it works. I think the hand held sprayer part may be plastic so I don't know how well that will hold up."
"OR";"I always loved andy Rooney but I did love the andy hardy movies. Hes funny always doing something.  These are a good clean fun family movie."
"OR";"Had this in the back of a Nuvo Fusion 20 and it worked well. I've moved it over to a 65 gallon where it's now solely running Phosguard and I'm still very happy with it. It's a great, small media reactor."
"OR";"For me it seemed alittle slow to take off, but once your into the film you understand that hey! I need to just hold in and listen to what it has to say otherwise I will miss the plot, once in I really enjoyed everything about the film. Worth purchasing really!."
"OR";"There are few flashlights as versital as this. Streamlight makes this device in many vetsions. I prefer the sportsman model as the tactical ones include an infra red led. If you have nvg's you might prefer the tactical versions.

There is one other big difference between the military and sportsman m"
"OR";"We are using it nearly every day to train our two year old Mixed Pit Bull rescue dog. We have a long way to go but we are very impressed with this book."
"OR";"One of the best dresses you can buy!! This dress fit PERFECT! I got so many compliments in this dress!! Great material and such an amazing color! I would recommend this dress if you are looking for something not revealing but beautiful!!"
"OR";"This is a darling presentation of the Bible for the kids!  Nice pictures and story boards that then direct the reader to the real story.  It is a big book for little hands, but my 2-5 year olds are enjoying the Bible."
"OR";"My 2 year old son loves this train set.  Especially because of the hill.  This toy is great for helping toddlers with there fine motor skills and patients.  Good toy with hours of enjoyment"
"OR";"fast service, the book came in less than a week,like new. The book had extactly what it said with some highlights and written pages. It was okay because it also helped me study and learn from those writtenpages it had :)thanks so much."
"OR";"Syn is all man....the story line made me angry with shar but it really was a great read....interesting. Read the preview of the book before purchasing. If it grabs you purchase one and read and then decide if you want to continue.  This is the only way you would appreciate the book."
"OR";"I just bought this today and loved it. You get episodes 21-24 on it. Chi loves hideki. Chis so cute i want a persoacon like chi or somona."
"OR";"Absolutely love this fabric steamer. It acts like a commercial steamer in that it's very lightweight, easy to use and gets the job done. I would recommend this product to anyone who is tired of ironing."
"OR";"Who says eating healthy means you have to say goodbye to sweets? This book surely does not agree with that assumption! Im looking forward to try out some of these dessert recipes soon. They look so good!"
"OR";"This is the best book to use to help students with poetry. We use it every year, I had one in my classroom but that wasn't enough so I bought more extra used copies for my classroom."
"OR";"They are inexpensive but are clear and seem to be well made and worth the price. Nice case to keep them in. Best part they are fulfilled by digital Goja an excellent company to do business with. Great customer service."
"OR";"This is lovely, but (as others have said) a little small.  When I first put them in my ears, they pinched and were uncomfortable for a while.  I found it very easy to bend the metal to make the grip a little looser, and after that they were far more comfortable."
"OR";"I did not buy this for hanging deer. I built a 9'x8' shelf in my garage and established it at about 4.5 feet so a car's nose could go under it, but there would still be sufficient room to store meaningful items on top of it (like snow blowers, lawn mowers, generators, etc...). The problem is getting"
"OR";"So now that I finally got them, they are wonderful, beautiful, and incredibly comfortable.  As always Ariat never disappoints. If you are looking for a good boot that's comfortable to walk and ride in then go with Ariat "
"OR";"I liked this book, because all the characters are shown with understanding compassion. It shows that second opportunities are possible, if you are open to them. Although there are some thought situations in the story, its not difficult to read, which is very infrequent for me, because Im too sensiti"
"OR";"It took me a while to get through this last book, but well worth it. I don't take to reading much but the Hunger Games series struck an interest that needed to be satiated. This last book was a great touch to finalize Katniss' life."
"OR";"Good device.  Not much to go wrong with.  However, I feel it would be good to have models that give you the option to have a larger diameter, larger width and more padding on the rubber coating."
"OR";"This stuff works, we have an older cat who has gotten very thin despite eating like a dog. Since we started mixing this with his food he's gained weight and he look healthier."
"OR";"I bought these to secure our 24' powerboat to the trailer. They work great... Easy to attach and ratchet, and easy to release. I wanted marine grade self-retracting tie-downs, and these fit the bill perfectly!"
"OR";"I loved this purse. But, it didn't last long. And without overstuffing it  I thought I would get longer use but the zippers broke. But I liked it a lot until I had to throw it away."
"OR";"We had a similar experience that someone else expressed - we have the the Maisto Desert Rebel 1967 Ford Mustang GT Radio Control Vehicle (1:10 Scale) and the Maisto Desert Rebel Volkswagen Beetle Radio Control Vehicle (1:10 Scale). Both of our vehicles came in the 49 Mhz frequency which makes them h"
"OR";"I gambled on these because I couldn't find them in a bigger size. I wear a 31 inch jean (Gap) and these are pretty snug! They are beautiful though, so if you're a size medium or smaller, they're a GREAT buy."
"OR";"A little small but works well.  The chair is super light weight and I had to put rubber non skid pads under the legs to keep people from sliding too much."
"OR";"This bulb works fine, but it in no way, throws yellow colored light.  Buy the yellow ""cork screw"" type bulbs if you REALLY want to keep bugs off your front porch."
"OR";"Happy that my daughter enjoyed these pretend play toys . But only things she keeps making the baby go potty which I have to order some soon. And it stick on right and fits doll great even up to 18inch dolls too"
"OR";"This movie was so stupid. The only good thing about this movie was Stuart Townsend but even he couldn't save this movie from getting more than one star from me. What were they thinking when they released this pile of trash?!"
"OR";"This is an excellent product.  We have had it only a short time, but it's great to find something that really works made by people who really care that their customers are satisfied.  Ask a question, and they will do their best to answer it."
"OR";"Pretty nice. It's like jersey material so it's comfortable but it still doesn't really look over casual. I expected it to be tighter based on reviews but if anything, I have a little wiggle room in it."
"OR";"This was a great gift for my 8 year old grandson.  He had a ball with it and spend quite a bit of time asking it questions!  Kept him busy MUCH longer than I thought it would"
"OR";"Works and fits great in my dad's car, we are using it to travel up north with my kids as I won't drive alone and my husband can't go. It will keep his car's seats clean!"
"OR";"Great classic. The prose was beautiful. The characters were complex and realistic. The social issues were handled really well. This book did a great job of showing the beauties and horrors of life. An excellent read, highly recommend."
"OR";"My daughter wanted a Christmasy sweatshirt and LOVED this one.  They do run small, she's about a size 4 so it fit her fine but if you like things loose fitting or you aren't slight, you'll want a bigger size."
"OR";"I haven't used it yet, but it seems fine.  It does run a little small for me.  Maybe a lot of people like to wear it tight but I want to be able to move a little."
"OR";"Not sure what scale this batmobile was made at but it sure is very large.  Finding a display case will not be easy.  Arrived packaged well in a box that was an appropriate size to deliver in.  Arrived on time also."
"OR";"The whole series taken as a whole is really good. More than one romance in a book and multiple juggled POVs are hard to pull off, but I would say she'd done it."
"OR";"I liked this book a lot, and want to read it again.  It's impossible not to be emotional reading this story.  Powerful and well written.  I will recommend it to my book club and others."
"OR";"Blast from the past...The knife is a great copy of a classic from long ago. The quality is good. The spork/opener also seems well made. No regrets on this purchase."
"OR";"The book is simple, but that makes it perfect for my 10 month old.  The colors are bright, the text is bold, and he enjoys touching the ""squashy"" nose and pulling the tail on the book."
"OR";"NEW BALANCE IS PRETTY ON THE MONEY IN SIZING. I WEAR A 10 1/2 WIDE BUT GOT AN 11 BECAUSE ITS A MEDIUM WIDTH. THESE SHOES FIT PERFECT AND ARE LIGHT AND COMFORTABLE TOO."
"OR";"My dogs love these treats, but I can't understand the HUGE price increase over the last few months.  I used to buy these on Prime for $21.99 for 6 boxes.  I can understand a small increase, but nearly $12?  Why?"
"OR";"Working great for over a week.  My installation is a bit different.  I am using it to activate a WEMO switch to turn on 100+ feet of LED cafe lights outside.  I have these in weather proof/resistant enclosures and have good outside WIFI due to an access point I have outside.  I had to drill a 1/2"" h"
"OR";"A great product I have bought several K and M heated pet beds over the years for the cats and they love them I even use one for a foot warmer in my bed."
"OR";"Julia and Noah's story is my first by this author and I loved it. It is a romance with a great technical story about extreme sports and not just fluff.  If you like your romance to have a a solid story behind it, this book is for you."
"OR";"My girl loves these pillows. A fun simple project that is long enough to have them focus, but not too long to loose interest. Plus its nice that it isn't just any toy taking up room in my house."
"OR";"These are great, I now have three of them.  They are big enough that I can put my car keys in the bag too.  The fabric seems to be durable and the zipper is well constructed.  I see this lasting a long time."
"OR";"Wasn't sure how much I was going to like this show at first, but towards the end I began to really enjoy it.  Excellent acting.  Looking forward to continuing on with it into the 2nd season and beyond."
"OR";"My 3 cats love this brush.  All I have to do is get it out of the drawer
and they come running.  Also use it to brush off hair that gets on the chairs
and sofa.  Comes in handy for keeping the cats and the furniture tidy."
"OR";"Really great quality, our 2 toddlers haven't been able to break it yet.  I wish it had a kick-stand (ordered one previously and sent it back since it kept tipping over)."
"OR";"Finally, just bricks!!! My 6 year old is really getting into building blocks. We have mostly Lego brand but have been frustrated that most of their sets because they are lacking just the basic blocks so our collection at this point has way too many specialty pieces. We were very happy with the base "
"OR";"This book is an icon. It melds together the new with the old. I read the book and keyed in on the vast minutia and trivia of the 70s and 80s... my son read it and keyed in on a lot of the modern day tech speak. GREAT BOOK."
"OR";"I washed them by hand before using and the dark color bleeds way too much especially the black one. I washed it 3 times and the color bleeding didn't stop so I gave up on it."
"OR";"High Quality. Works well on herbs. Nice cover for safety. Good for buying for self. Comes in very minimal packaging, would not give as a gift."
"OR";"I haven't read much Stephen King but I really enjoyed the Shining.  It has been referenced so much in pop culture and has influenced so many works it was great to finally read it."
"OR";"Usable but not as good as a namebrand one I've use.  The vacuum seal part is a little silly with having to turn clockwise and counter clockwise.  But ok - you pay for what you get is true."
"OR";"I fell in love with the illustrations in this book.
The Sandman brought this to my son, as a present for sleeping in his
own bed the whole night.
The story is sweet and it's a good bedtime story.
But the real prize here are the beautiful, dreamy pictures throughout."
"OR";"Way too small. I even bought a size up and they are still very tight. Almost less comfortable to cycle in these verses no padding (not saying much since there already is very little padding in these)"
"OR";"Great little Trimmers!  They're perfect for smaller sized birds!  They're sharp & don't split their nails.  They're just the right size for my tiels.

We got them really fast & are very happy with them!"
"OR";"This is so great! It's tall and pretty big though so beware, and make sure to measure before you buy it! I definitely recommend for anyone who needs somewhere to dry those hand washed dishes."
"OR";"Liked the idea of the agency and the intermingling of past and current agents .  Would like to see all three of them working together sometime. A feel good short story is always a refreshing change."
"OR";"Love these bottles. I make my coffee in the morning and bring it with me to,work,and it stays hot! I use the smaller one to have cold water during the day. Beautiful and stylish and the best of all they are amazing! They don't sweat and do their job!!!"
"OR";"These were cute, but just too bright to be my style. I guess I doubted how glaringly bright they would be, but after they arrived I just could not see staring at them all day. It would be dizzying. So I returned them. They fit as expected and looked comfy though."
"OR";"Was a. really great book.very exciting .I never lost interest.the book keeps you guessing. I've read the series twice now and have enjoyed the books"
"OR";"35 years in the mining industry and no one makes a better work boot on quality and safety than Oliver. Deserves 10,000 stars! Price was amazing as well!"
"OR";"Pretty silly cat toy, silly as in pointless. Concept is great, so I listened to the 5 star reviews and asked for this as a gift. From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment. It makes an annoying sound, but the worst part is that t"
"OR";"Great product. It's tall enough so utensils don't fall out, Short enough so you can take utensils out if you keep it on the counter with cabinets above and wide enough to hold quite a few utensils."
"OR";"Tried another brand, and that brand had unnecessarily much plastic, and only half the ballons came out ok. So back to Bunch O Ballons, because i will never fill waterballons one by one again."
"OR";"I thought it had great chemistry between the characters , I also thought it was really funny. I will read this book over and over. Has become one of my favorite alien love stories."
"OR";"Love the look, but it's a little flimsy...though honestly, I suppose that's fair for the price! I'm returning this one and ordering a larger and higher quality version!"
"OR";"First off, I'm a cable cutter, got tired of paying big $$ for basic tv.  Kept my internet so netflix and amazon are my primary movie outlets.

Wanted the antenna for local news/weather and sports.

With that said, I was very skeptical purchasing this contraption...so when it arrived, I was even more"
"OR";"This is the perfect Holiday short story read. I Loved this story as I always love Deanna Chase's writing. The relations ship between Jade and Kane is Awesome and I also enjoy the relationships between the friends and coven members."
"OR";"It is a good option for a beginner who does not mind spending the extra money.  It is over priced for the purpose it serves if you have good wood working skills.  It is a well made product 4 for quality but a 2.5 star for the price"
"OR";"One of the most amazing books I've ever read (and I rarely read fiction). When my wife and I finished the book, we ordered 12 more (to give away to people)."
"OR";"I went through about 4 different power adapters for my samsung galaxy.none of the others charge my device is optimally is this one, plus the length is awesome I really like this adapter I definitely recommend it as a great buy."
"OR";"In the beginning of the movie I was thinking that this was going to be something that I later wished that I hadn't bothered watching.  I kept watching and the movie ended up getting better and I thought the ending was good."
"OR";"Another book I could not put down.  It was a wonderful love story which is why I loved it.  So deep and fulfilling.  Cant wait to get the next new book"
"OR";"This scarf is crazy awesome. The price was so low i figured it would show up and be a piece of crap. But i said what the heck and ordered it anyways. Its so pretty and soft! I love it and am definitely going to order it in other colors!"
"OR";"I wasn't sure what I was getting with this one, but I am very glad I got it!  This authors take on shifters is different, especially the way the pack is run.

Love, hot sex, secrets abound. I'm off to get the next."
"OR";"I haven't read a historical romance in a very long time. after reading this book I remembered what I was missing. the chase, the heat when catching.  I really enjoyed reading this book."
"OR";"Great for hiding the cash and cards that we need to have on us but don't want people to see.  Now just have to remember to go to a quiet and private place to use it instead of showing bad guys what we have and where we have it."
"OR";"I would have never thought Rota could end the series tied up in such a nice neat bow after how the second book ended. It didn't seem possible. But she did it. Great series."
"OR";"A fitting name for this book. Glad Oliver got his happily ever after. I hope I get to see what happens to Jacob further down, that would make a great book."
"OR";"Nice solid machine.  The only negative is it's under powered.  Slows down when sanding large planks. Great for small piece sanding.  You just have to let the machine do the work and don't push to hard.  Great for the price."
"OR";"This is the second time it broke in the same area, the part where you push to close door and lock it.  They gave me a new one.  I have only had this a year with light use and it broke again.  Super annoyed, do not waste your money."
"OR";"The item finish is extremely well done. The reflection works very good on both black and white items. So far, I really do not have any complaints.

Thank you, I will definitely buy more from your store!!

Mario"
"OR";"I liked the story but I was dissapointed in the book itself.  I do not like the last part of the last book repeated in the first part of the next book.  Eve, Quinn and Bonnie should have been a trilogy skipping the repeated parts."
"OR";"Giving it two stars because the lights work. But the suction cup design does not hold it together as it shows in promos. Maybe ours is defective and if it worked as the promo shows I could give it more stars"
"OR";"I was really excited to get this air prey toy for my cats. However after 20mins it broke in 2 different spots ): I don't think I would buy this product again."
"OR";"This is a great book to share with your kids where you can both learn some really cool things about caterpillars!  Some really interesting facts that will get your child excited about learning and these cool creatures!"
"OR";"I liked the story.  I thought it was well written, even though I was confused in the beginning about who was talking in each chapter.  It gets clearer as you get to know the characters.  I liked the twists, the characters, the beginning and the end.  Very good read."
"OR";"I found it to be interesting and informative.  It was an excellent first hand account of suffering on several levels. I would recommend this book to anyone. who has been through a similar trauma, as they would no doubt find it encouraging."
"OR";"this sits by my bed side so haven't carried it around yet. I do like the ability to plug it in , but the radio is not as good as the one with my clock, so use this mainly with books on tape on cd's"
"OR";"Lovely tea kettle. Used to have stop top variety, but when I purchased new smooth stove decided to try this. Works great. Love the red color."
"OR";"I really wasn't sure if I wanted to get this book or not.  I finally decied not to get it after reading some of the reviews.  But later on I read about it in the Star Wars magazine and saw what it was about and some of the art in it.  I knew that I had to get it after reading that article."
"OR";"Great story. B&W, full screen, monophonic sound...BUT I never tire watching this. Great moral lesson. Those who you THINK are your friends may not be there for you when you really need them."
"OR";"I have a junior literature class and this book was good for them to read because it was high interest without being to wordy and difficult.  It was good to teach because of the underlying peer pressure with a very charismatic boy."
"OR";"For a memory foam/cooling gel pillow less than $100, this one is a quality product. Product is exactly as described, very soft, and keeps very cool. I wish it was not quite so soft, and was a bit firmer."
"OR";"A good story about choices. Tessa chose to break her engagement and leave without giving the Real she did so. She returned after three years to ber family and the man who gone on with his who still loved her, but was afraid to start over."
"OR";"I absolutely loved the story about Ed and Donna. It was magical, their first glimpse of one another, and how it turned out to be love at first sight. Even though they had different agendas......their love for each other allowed their differences
to work for them , not against  them. This was such a "
"OR";"jjt  I fell in love with this book.  I cried and I celebrated with this family as they fought for and found their child.  Autism is a challenge for the child and the family.  This family prevailed and Dale found a world of love."
"OR";"This strainer works well doing what it's intended to do which is to strain out what I don't want from a hot pot.  Looks good.  Just need a place to hang it to show it off rather than stowing away in a drawer."
"OR";"Loved the first one i had and now the 2nd one :)  Just wish there was an easier way to clean. No i will not get another removable plate design. Each one i had never heated evenly like this old school GF classic."
"OR";"Works like a charm. You can even put the lid back on the can if you need to. Freaking awesome. I might order more as gifts. If you know anyone that has problem working the manual openers, this would be a perfect gift."
"OR";"Good scriber. A little pricey, but you don't have much choice when it comes to these. It holds up well (if you don't lose the first one like I did), and the tip seems to be very hard and hold it's point. Would buy again (hopefully I won't have to."
"OR";"Feels comfortable. On my feet most of the day. The tongue does press on the top of mt foot at times but a little readjust and all is good. So far stitching is holding up well as well as the sole."
"OR";"This is a great lingerie bag.  I got two so I could use them to wash corsets that I wear with a period attire outfit from the 1800's.  The corsets come out of the washer just fine and are as clean as everything else."
"OR";"My granddaughter does not let the bus out of her site.  I would recommend the Calico Critters for all toddlers.  I started her with them at 2 and she is five now and still plays with all of them.  The house and all the stores you can get makes a great little town for them."
"OR";"If you love the classics you have to buy this collection.  I remember watching these movies and how scared I was.  It is like turning the clock back and being that young person again.  For all of you who have not watched this movie you must see it."
"OR";"This was book #2 in the Grass Valley series and just as wonderful as the first!  Half the time was laughing my butt off and the other half I just wanted to hug poor Trent. A wonderful love story I very much loved reading."
"OR";"My first book by this Author and I really enjoyed reading this book. How women were just used by their families. THIS HEROINE was very lucky after trying so hard to please everyone."
"OR";"I thought it was really funny and Woody Allen was great. I've passed this one around. Scarlett Johansson was good, as well. Fun to watch. I was pleasantly surprised."
"OR";"I totally enjoyed this book. I've experienced a church setting like the one written about in this book. But my eyes are still focused on God, in spite of humans, and our issues.  Church is what you make it; your motive for being there."
"OR";"It's being used as I write this review I am a first time builder had one issue with a plug to the case seemed very tight to me ,I do wish the manual had more explanation  and how to for the bios  I had to have a computer shop install the bios for me ,I would buy this again ."
"OR";"I love these shoes, I know have two pair and am going to order another!  The white is a patent leather, not just plain leather-it doesn't give that detail in the description. They are very comfortable and have great arch support."
"OR";"Great price. Very fast. Had it for over a year now with no issue.
Durable little thing.
I have owned this for years now and it is always taking punishment on my key-chain and still going strong. Very durable."
"OR";"Considering this old movie was in black & white it gave the perfect and
capturing that ""going back into time""  process. My 89 yr. old mom loved it as was
her Christmas gift."
"OR";"I love this roaster. I use it for everything from roasts to slow cooker. I would have given it 5 stars except after a year the enamel insert got a chip and so far I cannot find a replacement."
"OR";"This is the number 1 anime I recommend to all, it is one of the top 5 greatest of all time. It has amazing voice over work, amazing story and beautiful music. It is a must own and especially now that it is available on blu-ray."
"OR";"Yet another great work by Lee Child! If you are a fan of the Jack Reacher series, this book will not disappoint. Plenty of action. Get it! You've got nothing to lose!"
"OR";"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one c"
"OR";"Historical accuracy, interesting characters and compelling story lines, but it is Leon Uris. I was a little disoriented by the shift in times. The fewer sittings used to read it the better."
"OR";"Packed Well by Amazon and arrived undamaged.  However, all 6 of my cats didn't like it.  They picked at it and left if for the dogs to clean up!  First Friskies Flavor I've found that NONE of my cats liked!"
"OR";"It's not a pretty looking shoe, but they are VERY comfortable. Great for long walks. I bought them for my trip to NY city. I'm so in love with this shoes that I bought another pair."
"OR";"Excellent cliff-hanging continuation of the first four books. I am anxiously awaiting the 6th book and wishing I'd found Mr. Martin sooner.  Also wishing I read slower...."
"OR";"My Propet 3804 fit nicely they are a little heavier than the other models I have purchades. I just don't like the black and blue lable on the tongue. I would recommend this shoe to my friends and family."
"OR";"George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia and Matt Damon head a super-cast of stars (among others, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle -both of them, second timers with director Steven Soderbergh from Erin Brokovich and Traffic, respectively) in a movie about... yes, the traditional robbery theme! Seen it be"
"OR";"I love it!! Very pretty and good quality for the price!! Looks like the picture but prettier in person! I ordered 5 of them and lots of other jewelry and I'm VERY HAPPY!!"
"OR";"Enjoyed the story of Jojo and Vanni,  I liked how they progressed from friends to more and how they helped one another deal with their issues. Could have had a little more detail into her coping and the scars she carried."
"OR";"Great keyboard. This is the perfect keyboard for when you have your computer hooked up to your TV for watching movies.

WARNING: It is fairly small, I wouldn't recommend this keyboard for heavy long-term use, keys are small as well."
"OR";"These work really good for dogs that like to pull. Takes a little bit of time for the dog to get used to it but use lots of treats and positive reinforcement. With this on your dog will not be able to pull you around on the leash anymore."
"OR";"I do not understand all of the negative reviews for this item. I have had good experiences with my use for the worksite radio/charger. I get a good strong radio signal, the sound quality is excellent, clock and presets save, and its great with the Iphone."
"OR";"This film is so entertaining and so cool, a great tribute to 70's Westerns and Martial Arts films. Just watching Uma Thurman in her yellow outfit similar to Bruce Lee's in his unfinished project ""The Game of Death"" has to bring back memories for Martial Arts movie fans everywhere.
The fight things a"
"OR";"Great transformer for small children. My 4yr old can easily transform it by himslef (big plus for Dad) Well made and has held up to rough play well."
"OR";"Great toy for the beginner user of remote controls. However it does have limited movements. Also be sure to turn off when not in use because it will kill the batteries in between uses. All in all a good buy."
"OR";"This was a most interesting short and sweet story. Knighthawk and Abby were great characters. The setting in the Alleghany  Mountains sounded beautiful. Knighthawk (Zane) had built his very  nice cabin and furniture and the rest you should enjoy yourself."
"OR";"Good deal, cheaper then the sports stores. Nice ball to practice, with but since they are light, cant be of much use to determine ball flight only contact. Good for limited space."
"OR";"I've been using this product for over a year. I am on a septic system and some products are not as easy to use as others. This is a great item. My dishes are spotless and there is no gross chemical smell during or after the wash."
"OR";"I purchase this sleeve when I purchased my Acer 15 inch Chromebook and it does fit the laptop just fine but because of the large size it should have handles as it is too large and too heavy to one hand it like you would a tablet in a sleeve."
"OR";"It works very well for smoothing my cat's coat. It does not remove tough knots but I have a very fine tooth comb for that. This is a finishing brush. I like that the metal bristles retract, making it easy to clean."
"OR";"Overall, I really love this item. My 10 month old loves it too. The best feature is of course the canopy. We wouldn't get to stay in the pool for as long as we do without the canopy. The sun can be so damaging, even with sunscreen on, so this allows me to not worry so much about that. The baby is 10"
"OR";"I was concerned by the other review that it might not fit and at first I put it on wrong but I got out the manual and followed it and it fit just right. Other reviewer may have had a real poor fit issue, though.  But now I can shred!"
"OR";"Good reading.  A nice western story that holds your interest from the beginning. Good clean reading for those of us who don't like bad language."
"OR";"I also ordered 2E.  Way too narrow--cramped my feet right away.  Had to take them off and return.  Was VERY disappointed.  I have a pair of 2E mesh asics that are VERY comfortable.  Really wanted the non-mesh to work, but no dice."
"OR";"Adorable and well worth the $33!  Bought this item to give a girlfriend as a birthday gift and she seemed to like it as much as I did.  Shes lucky I didn't decide to keep it!"
"OR";"My daughter had a strawberry shortcake one for her party that we hung it up in her room like a giant poster. We didn't get this for a party we got it for my sons room. He is a super hero fan and I loves it as much as my daughter loves hers."
"OR";"These were exactly what I expected. They look great (clean). I use them to keep my flour/sugar/etc. on the counter for easy access. I haven't noticed any air leaking into the canisters either. They are very light, and they get the job done."
"OR";"My little boy loves prehistoric animals. When I saw this wooly I knew he would be so happy to have it as an addition to his collection. I am happy to report the item is of great quality and very detailed. Happy buyer."
"OR";"This hidden pocket is very easy to use and is made with quick dry material. I was able to put cards and money in the pocket and wear it with no bulge showing. It is discrete and comfortable to wear."
"OR";"You tend to think #3 of any series will probably loose something and not be as good as the previous two but NOT so for this series. This is as edge of your seat as the first two. Get this one, you will NOT be disappointed."
"OR";"This is exactly what i needed.
These are so much better than the cheap plastic stays you get with shirts.
I end up forgetting to take them out every once in a while when I take my shirts to the cleaners.
At this price I just buy a new box every other year."
"OR";"I was intrigued by this, having seen a part of an episode on tv. It starts off great, interesting characters, good plot but then becomes silly and the end of Series One is so ridiculous that I threw the box in the garbage!"
"OR";"I like my transmitter  for the most part there isn't a lot of intereference like I had with my last one. Though there are still times that I still get it if I try adjusting the volume or heat."
"OR";"The door/window switches are amazingly accurate and work great with my smart hub.  Would give it 5 starts but the motion sensors, bought two sets, go offline at random."
"OR";"Works well, Two issues.  It is impossible to focus on higher magnifications without having the object being looked at up inside the opaque plastic cone.  Also the light is not dimmable and is sometimes too bright."
"OR";"Cute shoe but odd fit...heel length was great, but too long between toe strap and end of flip flop.  One shoe fit different than other shoe.  Wouldn't order again."
"OR";"I really loved this when I first got them, even though they are very long (I am 5ft). However, after just a few washings, they starting pilling big time. I still wear them every now and then, but not in public. They were nice to have a few months post-partum though."
"OR";"Not real happy with my product. It is a tiny package, much smaller than you would think. If you want 250 pieces of tiny little washers it might be what you would want. Most of this is a waste for me."
"OR";"This knife is just perfect for an EDC. great size, deep clip, razor sharp. Bottle opener needs work and I haven't used the screwdriver yet, but not really interested in those. All in all, for the price, a steal !"
"OR";"I didn't love this.  I was looking for something new in the genre because I feel like I've read all of it and this was too clich and predictable for me.  the character development was non-existent.  Just didn't like it."
"OR";"Good movie! This movie is not for the ""Politically Correct"" or those who are easily Offended! I really don't see the problem as Django wins everything in the end! Hats off to Jaimee Fox and Samuel L."
"OR";"These are great - vibrant colors and fun shapes, especially for preschoolers looking to have fun with letters!  My only issue (reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that sometimes the backing is hard to peel off."
"OR";"If you are reading this review you probably already own a pair of Chucks. I love the look and feel of the Lo Top ones. They look great and feel great."
"OR";"This book was a great read!  Cool inside look into the secret service.  I always wondered what they have to deal with.  They see everything and have to be so neutral and give up so much!  Very interesting wish  there was more on the current players but understand why that is impossible."
"OR";"I learned a lot from this book.  There is a lot of information on how to structure your tweets and what kind of tweets.  I had never seen any one separate them in those categories before.  Keeping as a reference.  I'm now interested in his other books."
"OR";"If this was the only gift my 4 year old grandson received he would not have cared.  He wanted this gift from Santa and got it.  The best thing about this gift was the quality time he spends with his Dad making the cars."
"OR";"A very tight fit in ports and slow speed but the design is irresistible and I love storing my files on it to wear as a sort of charm. Got mine as a gift from a great friend and I treasure it."
"OR";"These look and feel pretty cheap.  Unfortunately i didn't open quickly and missed the return window with vacation.  Would love to return them.  They also run big."
"OR";"I love my Vellux Blanket and have had them in the past.  I like that they are also great for allergies. That it is light weight, yet warm for the winter and light enough for the summer.

I will always have a Vellux ....

Thank you,
Kathy from California"
"OR";"Nice product - works well BUT absolutely no instructions were included with it! The way it works is 5 stars - but I had to experiment with it for several days to figure how it worked (distances, etc)"
"OR";"My 4 yr old daughter loves this doll. She played with one at our neighbor's house and fell in love with it. I wish the screws weren't showing, but otherwise it's a very sweet little doll."
"OR";"It was an enjoyable read and worth the cost of the book!  The plot was weak to me, but the majority of the characters were carry over from her other books!  Also a little to much techno solutions for quick resolve!"
"OR";"My son loves this! The older he gets, the more he enjoys it. He ate the sticker off of the front. Wish this had been colored plastic instead because now the large button is just white. Doesn't seem to bother him though!"
"OR";"Does what it says.  Seems well made and durable  Not some cheap, flimsy piece of plastic crap from China, though it may be from China, who knows.  Bottom line is its well made, you can just tell."
"OR";"Love the headphones.  Very easy to operate (as I would expect most these days would be!) and the sound quality, for someone who's not a ""pro,"" is really great.  I like how the speakers themselves swivel so that they will fit perfectly.  Very impressed and I would recommend to anyone."
"OR";"Smart, funny, awesome - you know, all the good stuff you want in a story.  Loved the relationships between the characters and the sense of humor present even while trekking a truly touching story. Good stuff."
"OR";"It does not get hot! I love the way that this feels, and co-sleeping with a new baby there are lots of accidents. My brand new Tuft& Needle mattress is still spottless thanks to this purchase!"
"OR";"I read this book because I was really interested in how this religion worked was craziness they were meant to believe. I was sad that at 15 she was force to marry still a child and what she had to adorn and what she had to leave behind when she finally wanted to get out"
"OR";"Two of the pans worked fine. The 8"" pan didn't. I had to put a 6""x6""by 1/8"" steel plate under it to get it to work. The non-stick coating works as expected. For the price it is what it is."
"OR";"I just keep this on the floor and when my cat is feeling frisky he will carry it around everywhere lol.  It's cute, but I think a little pouch for catnip would have really got the cats going.  Overall they play with it so it works for me."
"OR";"Only 3 out of 4 bulbs worked. I have been using them for 3 weeks now and they are all turning black. They look terrible if they are off. My first impression was good deal but not at all after 2 weeks it went downhill."
"OR";"Our vet told us that ticks gave become resistant to frontline and it does not work as well as it used to. It has treated us well for years but after finding several ticks on our dog this year we switched to a newer product."
"OR";"...but look at each others dish first to see what the other guy got! LOL. Why the red dye, 9Lives? AND I haven't had to use a can opener to open a can in a long time. I will not buy this again."
"OR";"so far i haven't thrown it only gone through the motion.. and wow does this thing force your muscles ( quick jumpers and stabilizers ) to grow because this thing is heavy, you must be in control of the point of this knife it is 4 sided and can do damage. imagine your  bullseye on your target (the ce"
"OR";"I never actually got to use this.  It seemed to be charging fine, but after the first day, it stopped charging and is now useless.  Unfortunately the package got thrown out so now I cannot return it, but if I could, I would."
"OR";"Enjoyed the continuing interaction between a loner and his dog. Solid writing, kept me enthralled and made me feel part of the story. I enjoy training German Shepherd and picked up some insights that I will be able to use"
"OR";"This is a really nice quality glass bowl. I use them as fish bowls - they are a really clean design, and my two Betta boys, Alpha and Mopey Dick, love them!"
"OR";"These are good socks comfortable on ankles don't slide down but too thin for my foot cause my feet need more support,for pain and swelling. good for summer. Feet don't get sweaty with this material."
"OR";"I bought this for a tween-ager and the shirt fit through the chest and shoulders but is oddly long, like a dress. Maybe on an adult it would be OK. Having said that though, the message has gotten RAVE reviews."
"OR";"ParaNorman is a good movie it looks almost like the movie Coraline  but with zombies I bought both Films Coraline and ParaNorman  for my niece and nephew They liked it A lot."
"OR";"This worked great in the wire cage I had just purchased for my dog. It stayed straight and no water spilled from the bowl. It kept the bowl from being dumped in the cage which would have made a real mess."
"OR";"Not a bad little device. I have owned this MP3 player for several days now and it is everything I expected it to be. Loading music is astonishingly easy. the 15 GB of storage will take me quite a while to fill up. There is an SD card slot that I don't expect that I will ever have reason to use. I di"
"OR";"I adore this book- got it as a gift and have given it as a gift, too.  Really terrific read that gives interesting info and practical advice for how to get the most out of the foods you buy or grow."
"OR";"I got this for my granddaughter for her birthday this summer and she really enjoys it. She started taking pictures immediately. She just turned 3 but is already getting the hang of using it. It is simple to use and also withstands being dropped. Great product."
"OR";"Bought one for my child when they were an infant and they still have it as school aged. Had traveled on every long trip with us and been slept with every night and still feels great and looks good. This is a wonderful little bear."
"OR";"Love Nora Robert's books,  Strong women, a little intrigue, a little romance...just right for a good read.....have read many of her books"
"OR";"I'll be honest. I didn't buy it to build what the box shows. I just wanted the extra bricks to go nuts with my imagination. It's a manageable price, delivered fast, in great condition, and is exactly what I wanted."
"OR";"Great colors and look beautiful.  My child loves all three hats that I got. Great for spring weather and we will use in during the fall or cool summer nights."
"OR";"I love the characters (and there are many!) and although there are many, each one retains their own individual identities. I love the intricacies of the plot. I love the action. I could go on, but I'm dying to start the next book in the series. I highly recommend it."
"OR";"I didn't buy them for the quality. I bought them because my granddaughter wanted to tie dye a set of sheets. I usually like a much higher thread count, but these were great for what I had in mind"
"OR";"I used these by the millions (well, maybe not millions...). Not thick or super grip, but the extra length makes up for that. At the price of these you can use them everywhere. Also, cut them in half for smaller cords."
"OR";"Just finished the ten books of the Scandalous Duchess Series. Easy, enjoyable and entertaining story. Am looking forward to reading more books by Marti Talbott."
"OR";"I really wanted to like this book because I really liked the characters. It was just really boring and slow moving. This was my first Nora Roberts book and probably my last. Sorry."
"OR";"I almost gave it only 3 stars.
But, I decided that because it did the job I had hoped it would, I would give it 4 stars.
I would have given it 5 stars, except that after a couple of weeks, the foam padding on the kneeling board is showing signs of breaking down.
It will not last much longer.
I'll ha"
"OR";"I've long shied away from bluetooth earbuds because it's annoying when the battery dies, but my corded earbuds were a hassle on runs and such. They didn't stay in my ears well and I would catch the cord and rip them out of my ears. The Phaiser earbuds have changed my tune (pun intended) on BT earbud"
"OR";"Works, and for cheap memory works well. Used in a test ESXI box hosting 3 windows server VMs and a pfsense box. No issues so far, 3 months of use."
"OR";"I will admit that Miss Oak is new to me so it took me a while to get in the groove of her writing, but once I did.....wow can't wait to get the next one. PS....I absouletley LOVED Rachel"
"OR";"Bought several for use with an iPhone 6.  They're very well made, much nicer than the Apple cables, and are all still in excellent condition after moderately rough use."
"OR";"I was hoping my two male cats would like it.  One of them will eat one or two pieces, the other just walks away from it.  Going to have to donate the whole box to the Animal Shelter.  Maybe they will have better luck."
"OR";"I wanted this automatic toothbrush dispenser for my son. He is 6  with high functioning Autism. Im trying to teach him to be more independent. He knows how to brush his teeth, but has a hard time getting the cap off the tooth paste and squeezing it to get the paste out. When I saw this on Amazon, I "
"OR";"I use this mat to protect my floor from a litterbox, and it's worked perfectly. No leaks or stains on the floor and it catches a lot of litter. I'd order bigger if I could go back in time."
"OR";"Great product!  Works like a charm!  My granddaughter loves how the lights go with her music and likes going through all the colors.  Would definitely buy again!"
"OR";"My grandson loves his Cars cars and Mater is a must-have for any child who loves the movie.  He especially loved attaching McQueen and other cars to Mater's tow hook.  I only with the hook was a bit sturdier."
"OR";"I loved this novella that allowed us to enter into the lives of Joss and Braden. It has all the emotional aspects of their relationship and it was expertly written and delivered! I can't wait for the next book in the series!"
"OR";"Great quality and have a comfortable grip to hold the cup, keeps drinks cool for a little while, it isn't that insulated where it will stay cool all day long but probably an hour or so anyways."
"OR";"Z1, my male betta, loves this food. He attacks every pellet ferociously, and by the looks of it, this quantity will last me at the very minimum six months! I wish I could eat like him at this price."
"OR";"The fit and feel of the top are fine but it's see through so I won't be wearing it. I hate bras and this shirt needs a strapless bra. I got the Yellow color so maybe if you get a different color it will be wearable."
"OR";"The second book of the Crossfire series, was great!  Getting to learn more about Gideon's past and how deeply he loves and cares for Eva was wonderful.  The intensity between Eva and Gideon is beyond hot, and I can't wait for book 3!!!!"
"OR";"I enjoy all the Meg Mysteries, but this story highly delightful. I am looking forward to reading some more fun fill stories
Thanks for the great entertainment on a cold night!"
"OR";"Cassie Hayes hit it out of the park with this one. I had a very hard time putting it down. This story is a beautifully written clean story with lots of life lessons. There is so much packed in this story. I cannot wait to read the future books in this series."
"OR";"Gargoyles has got to be one of my all time Favorites and it an American production too, now that's really something. However, Disney on the other hand BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! I think that Disney is owned by a Secret Society and that's why they're so EVIL.(PH34R T3H 3V1L) Can you think of a better EXCUSE? "
"OR";"Not a good read. The characters do not grow from book one or within this book. The situations are not believable. There is still an underlying interesting plot. That does not equal the weaknesses stated above."
"OR";"Fits good, looks good, scratched my new LCD screen, even though I am very careful when covering the TV.  The inside front material should have some padding or a soft layer."
"OR";"Not a kids' book, but very interesting read.  You have to suspend disbelief for the initial event, but otherwise everything follows naturally. The construction of the story (alternating viewpoints) makes you want--NEED--to keep reading!"
"OR";"I love the material & the design; however, the belt clip doesn't hold firmly enough.  Bend over & it pops off easily.  I really wanted to love this.  Sadly, it will probably sit on the shelf."
"OR";"We like this electronic version alright. The convenience of the cards and electronic banking make game play faster and smoother, but this game is very different. Life tiles have been replaced with action cards and the action cards are so different. They may say something like ""Have a dance contest w"
"OR";"I cannot live without this product. I can not express how much I love love love this shampoo. Smells amazing and leaves my pups super smooth and shiny! Highly recommend!!!"
"OR";"It's kind of hard to control, so I would probably order it for 5 year old, but not younger. I also think you need a pretty big sandbox or the sand will get all over. My turtle sandbox is not big enough."
"OR";"Had a little problem seeing the drive with Windows 10.  Emailed vendor and got instruction responses promptly. It's a little noisy; but, works.  Great value for $20."
"OR";"I liked this book but I didn't love it! I had some issues with Allie. To me a lot of the time she came across as self-centered, snobby and judgmental! I also hated how she would say ""my half brother"" all the time, I get that we need to know that, but if we are to believe she loves and cares for her "
"OR";"I had bought this for a class and fell in love with the book! It is a great tale of life love and sacrifice in order to save the only world these young people had ever known."
"OR";"Love the dinner plates. They are a nice size and I would describe them as very sleek and trendy..  They are not very heavy. But that is good for me. They stack nicely in my cabinet and don't take up much space. My daughter love them and wanted to order a set."
"OR";"Pretty,went beyond expectations, doesn't look cheap, good material and quality..only thing is that it didn't come with tag so I'm wondering if someone returned it. But still in love with the jacket"
"OR";"It is pretty thin stuff.  Is not the heavy duty tarp you are used to.  But then again have had it out covering my wood pile for a long time now and seems to be as strong and water proof as day one.  So, I would say for the price I am satisfied!"
"OR";"I used this zombie mask for a Halloween prop I was building, came out great and I got a lot of compliments on it. For the price, it's a pretty decent mask. Item looks just like the picture."
"OR";"I totally enjoyed this book and the story line . Khyree is like every other man wants his cake and eat it too until precious give him a taste of his own medicine ! Can't wait for saga to continue"
"OR";"My washing machine leaks and I cant find the leak. This is much better than towels under the machine. I also bought some anti-vibration pads to raise the machine up a bit. Works great with the pan."
"OR";"It is great fun flying this around inside or outside the house. Be careful flying outside. It climbs very fast and really easy to lose it. Product came very fast and on time. Price was good."
"OR";"Not a long period of use, but has worked as well or better than the original Sears battery that came with my drill.
Holds charger longer than original battery even when latter was new. Has full power."
"OR";"I bought this for my 6 month old twins (Boy & Girl) They mainly chew on it. It keeps them entertained for a few minutes. It is more entertaining if an adults uses it to interact with the baby.

The quality is great. It will last a long time."
"OR";"Great story, well written and easy to pick up and start again which is great for traveling.  I loved reading about their travels and think this is worth reading."
"OR";"Great knife for heavy work around camp or around the yard.  A little heavy if you are packing in to camp somewhere but will handle about anything.  It took a good edge pretty easily...."
"OR";"Cheap looking watch - I guess because it IS a cheap watch.  I thought I was getting a bargain buying an $80 watch for just $12, but turns out, it really is a $12 watch that I would not give to anyone.  I returned it."
"OR";"great products from bosch as always.  i am really impressed with the impact driver & don't know how i ever got things done without it.  now i ask my wife, ""honey, you got any pictures that you need hung?"""
"OR";"Love it.  It's sturdy and spins well despite a lot of weight on it.  I placed several large glass jars containing dry goods and it makes it a snap to get what I want in my deep kitchen cabinet."
"OR";"My dog, Sadie, use to get hot spots and after I switched her to this grain-free food they stopped! Her favorite is the Salmon, but she also like the Bison. Good choice for any picky eaters too."
"OR";"Purchased this as a gift for my son, who is obsessed with all things Snoopy.
He loves the classic ""Cutes and Ladders"" already, and this game adds another element to the gameplay making it a little different and interesting."
"OR";"We didn't quite finish it, but the ideas in the book we did read were very interesting. This is something more people should read, it's not boring and long like a textbook but presents very important information and ideas."
"OR";"The fit was great but the quality of the adhesive was not :(  I loved not having to wear a bra but I had to worry about them coming off which 1 did... For the cost of them I was hoping for a better quality of adhesive. I will not be purchasing these again and do not recommend either."
"OR";"Works great! Once we changed out the filter the hand vac works so much better. I didn't want to purchase a whole
New vac and thanks to this I didn't have to. You will definitely notice a big difference in performance!"
"OR";"I'm not much into paranormal, this this was great! It's all about shifters, those people who can shift from human into wolves and other creatures, with various powers. There is the fight of good against evil, of course, but it seems to be all in fun and the characters have a great time."
"OR";"One would think super hot college girls would be enough to keep me watching a show, no matter how bad.  I could only watch 13 minutes; should have quit after 3."
"OR";"Good sturdy rug suitable for use in a beach house or where there is heavy traffic & dirt. It has a natural rustic appeal & can be cleaned by being shaken out. It works very well in my heavily used hallway."
"OR";"I have really enjoyed all of Joseph Kanon books that I have read so far.  This book give good insight into Venice post World War II and the people who lived thru the Nazi occupation of the city."
"OR";"What a bargain for a solid, well-designed saw.  I love the laser guide, and it's easy to change blades.  For less than $35,the perfect kick-around saw to destroy!  Buy a better blade though...."
"OR";"These things are great.  Love the 3"" size and the brightness is powerful.  Also, they dim wonderfully.  Would be nice if they were IC (insulation Contact) approved.  I do a lot of remodeling and IC is almost always required."
"OR";"Highly creative format that encourages a young child to think about themselves and gives them a venue to ""talk"" about themselves. My granddaughter received this same book when she was in First Grade and loved seeing how her life has changed in a few years. I highly recommend this book."
"OR";"I always feed my dogs and foster dogs this.  I never have a problem transitioning them from the shelter food to this and now skin issues!!!  Dogs eat and love it.  Recommend it to all people that adopt!
Wonderful food."
"OR";"I have had one for 14 years. Got 2 more from amazon. same great construction and fit. This product can SAVE YOUR LIFE. so do not get ELECTROCUTED get a hotheadz instead."
"OR";"This movie is not that bad. For an abandoned mine story I think they did pretty well and found myself to be mildly entertained all the way through. Its a typical story, well done. This movie definitely deserves a better rating than most people are giving it."
"OR";"very disappointing Christmas gift for our granddaughter. She opened it expecting the table to have lights and sounds but got nothing. We thought it might just need new batteries but that did not work. Very upset with this item!"
"OR";"Predictable outcome but the story woven around it was good. Would have liked a little more time spent on developing the emotional connection between the two.  Enjoyed the movie none-the-less."
"OR";"Bought this set for my wife to snorkeling in the Bahamas. She did and the guide/ lead snorkeler told here this set was a top line one. Not the very best, but really good. So get yours today!"
"OR";"These Toms are so comfortable and classy for when you want be casual yet comfortable. i highly recommend them. I love this neutral brown color because it won't get dirty easily but matches with a lot of stuff!"
"OR";"Got this for my best friends dog. I didn't realize it had a ""cat bell"" rolling around inside it. Thought it was kind of strange to have that in a dog toy, but it's def thick material for a dog to chew on."
"OR";"I followed the advice of the other reviewers and ordered my Georgia Boot Romeos a half-size larger than usual, and they fit perfectly.  They were extremely comfortable right out of the box, and i have been happy with them ever since.  Highly recommend."
"OR";"Great story.  Half a tale about running and ultra marathons, half the story of Gobi and getting her out of China.  Wish there was a little more about Gobi's new life in the UK."
"OR";"Finally an affordable respirator. Will utilize this for my hobby. Easy clip assembly for canisters. And can be used to accept a variety of filters designed for this model. Thanks for a great product, good price too!"
"OR";"I'm not a critic, but I really enjoyed this book. Also liked ""A Time to Kill"" which introduced the characters in this story. You could read this as a stand alone, but I would read A Time to Kill first to get to know some of the characters."
"OR";"The quality for the metal branches is not that great, the edges are sharp too. They are mediocre, got them for my formal dining room, but will use them for casual dining instead. The pics look better than the actual product."
"OR";"My dog eats these like a treat. Only time will tell if giving these are worth it. She is young but I read that it doesn't hurt to start when young so have no idea if this is working or not. But, will continue to give to her. No harm and maybe something to gain."
"OR";"The box is not deep enough, large envelopes and magazines don't drop in the box, you have to pull down the handle to make it drop. The outgoing mail clip is made for #10 business envelopes and slightly larger, if you put a greeting card in there it is visible from the outside. The clip should be mou"
"OR";"My preschool students had a hard time with the wands.  They didn't really hold the bubble solution.  It was nice to get so many for a reasonable price.  Used when teaching about things blowing in the wind."
"OR";"If you want a great quality knife this is the one. It is a little large for a pocket which is why I slide it in my belt line near my back pocket. You can't go wrong with this knife!"
"OR";"I couldn't put the book down once I started it.  I always look forward to reading one of his books.  The characters are well thought out and this one was a page turner."
"OR";"Ok bag. one of the pouches has 2 snaps instead of one snap and one to go into, and the bow fell off.. I had to see it back on, I was a little disappointed, but my daughter liked it."
"OR";"It is a pretty simple device. For me the nice feature was the built in igniter. It is very reliable and easy to operate.  It keeps your hands away from the flame when you light it. Very handy for those that don't use torches a lot."
"OR";"I almost gave up on this book in the beginning, but I'm glad I didn't. It wasn't nearly as good as ""captive in the dark"" but it had that feel. I wish there was a little more romance/love from Tane at the end. I guess that's not what their relationship is though."
"OR";"An excellent product, solid and well-made. These relatively rare black-colored ones were about four times more expensive than the usual red-colored ones, although both are made of the same molded ABS plastic."
"OR";"These are very comfortable.  I really like the terrycloth cloth on the sides, it's great for quick sweat control on your face.  The cushioning is perfect and your hands don't get over heated in the summer."
"OR";"My daughter has been watching the Supernatural series from the very start and was missing the seventh season. I bought it for her as a black Friday deal so it was super cheap and it arrived in record time. She loves it! I recommend it to anyone who loves Supernatural."
"OR";"Quality wires.  If you are not using RGB, you can split the wires in sets of 2s and basically double the lengths.  I used this to run LED strips under my cabinets and it worked great."
"OR";"This book kept me reading. There are different definitions of 'lost' that are embodied in all the characters, and this, combined with intertwined mysteries, kept me engaged. Also enjoyed the device of alternating current day with past events."
"OR";"I have 4 dogs, a french bulldog, 2 pugs, and a cardigan welsh corgi. All 4 dogs loved this product!  Even the 2 pugs that normally are not enticed by antlers or other chew toys."
"OR";"I use everything it comes with and the best part is that there are more things in this that what I can even think of what to use it for. This product was purchased using a promotional code to receive item at discounted price."
"OR";"Tori never disappoints. Cody a deputy sherrif and Charlie a former sniper could not be more different. Sparks fly with the bullets. She always gives you twist and turns. Love all of her books."
"OR";"I remember the first time I saw this movie, it took such unexpected turns.  That's what makes it interesting.  Def does a good job reminding us about the things that really matter."
"OR";"Excellent pocket knife and just what I was looking for.  Sharp out of the box and is easy to open once you get the feel for it.  A little on the heavy side but it's really nice for the money.  I don't think you could go wrong, all things considered."
"OR";"love it. it looks great in my kitchen and holds a ton. i had a wooden book shelf but it was buckling under the weight of the cans. love this one and it is customizable. we bought 2 and put half of the shelves from the second one on the first so we had more storage."
"OR";"I bought this as a gift and was told that it was a great book.  I don't know about the violence, sexual content, or how it was narrated because I didn't read it.  All I know is that he said it was great."
"OR";"Fun twist on what could happen to the Titanic.  While reading this book I've become more interested in the history of the ship.

A fun, light read that you'll get through quickly."
"OR";"I like the durability of these, I am not sold on their oblong size. I bought these because I was under the impression that they fit in spice jars. They don't fit as well as I'd hoped. You need to do some manipulating which causes some of the measurement to fall out."
"OR";"I love this product....I am a photography student with the thought of going professional and this was nice and vibrant just like the one in the studio at school.  It came to me wrinkled but I stretched it out and let it hang and they are coming out."
"OR";"I'm leaving this review on behalf of Brodi, my puggle. He enjoys these treats almost as much as he enjoys licking his weiner behind my back. Plus, they're good for him. I have this one on auto-renew."
"OR";"Been using this belt for multiple shooting classes with a holster and around town. I have had no issues with it. Great belt and works even better with there striker pants that are also excellent, but pricey."
"OR";"When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the brac"
"OR";"this was an ok book. if you liked the other dukes of war this one sounds promising but is slow and there is no closure with the other books. I always like to have all the books hooked up in the end. very disappointed."
"OR";"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I got it used through [...].  Some comic turned movies, or cartoon turned movies are not that great.  This is well worth the money.  Plus, it has Jessica Alba in it!"
"OR";"I bought this to go with my new 14"" cast iron wok. I love it . It cools down quickly, is light weight but not skimpy, The wooden handle is a must have. Fits the wok very nicely."
"OR";"Works like a charm. Took about 30 seconds to program on my 10 y.o. Liftmaster opener. As advertised, with Amazon delivery and backing; I would buy again and would recommend to a friend."
"OR";"Works nice for storing my several SD cards for my DSLR and Camcorder - and helps to keep them separate.  More space/storage than what I need but works well.  And, it's got enough bulk to not get ""lost"" in my camera bag."
"OR";"If your child likes MLP, he or she will love this helicopter. It includes Pinky Pie a clothing rack, luggage and two skirts. The helicopter is sturdy and a nice addition to the MLP toy series."
"OR";"These are cute, but they don't work at all. My daughter (5) picked these out, I think she wanted to use them at the zoo, but really it's just a pretend set of binoculars. They are really durable though."
"OR";"THOR is a great action movie, full of conflict and resolution.  The plot is well written and the movie, though a fantasy, is fun to watch.  It made me hope for a sequel."
"OR";"This was on my hubby's xmas gift list.  He just loves it and uses it every day.  It is sturdy, attractive and easy to use.  My only problem with it is that we got the peppercorns long before the pepper mill arrived."
"OR";"A pretty easy read but it took me a while to get into the story. Overall, a good book, but I'm not sure what I got out of it other than the knowledge of how badly horses were treated in the 1800's. I'm glad that there are laws to protect animals today."
"OR";"Happy happy satisfied awesome lovely thankful . I'm going to order more asap. I AM going to also order my DAUGHTER a set. I like the Length width. Thank you."
"OR";"Great little case for Canon compact cameras, like Canon 130 IS, and Canon 320 HS. Snug fit, easy to get out, good protection.  Feels well-made and durable."
"OR";"This is a nice heavy reliable abrasive saw. Good vice, good bearings, good guards. This is a workhorse. For lighter gauge steel cutting I made my own chop saw. Check it out - [."
"OR";"I never expected to like this movie after reading what it was about but thought I would try it for a few minutes. I was so pleasantly surprised. This movie is fantastic. It is so original and all of the actors were superb. I have told everyone I know that this is a must see"
"OR";"the story just didn't capture me. the plot feels .... lacking. it's not a movie I'd watch over again.
the biggest issue is that I feel there are no chemistry between the main characters and for a romantic film. geez. no wonder why they have a lot of mix reviews."
"OR";"A unexpected gem. Funny, tender and touching. My son and I really enjoyed this movie and would watch it again. Jon Favreau wrote, directed and stared in this movie with a very good supporting cast."
"OR";"I love this watch. I use the quick timer for watching the garden water and cooking. I set the alarm to remind me of places I have to be. It tells the correct time. I lasts and lasts. I had the battery replaced after a long time."
"OR";"Seems to work most of the time I've only had it for a short while and some times I have to play with the plug to get it to work and the pie shows the low power working every 10 minutes"
"OR";"Have been using it for a week continuously. Great battery life and quality. Very easy to pair and use with devices. Noticed the audio drop when the phone is moves a lot. Would definitely not go back to a wired headphone!"
"OR";"This bag is adorable and even more so in person! It's completely adjustable, has lots of pockets, and seems very high quality. I've had $200 purses that show more wear in a day than this one has shown in a week."
"OR";"For the price, this is a good deal. It's a very small box. Probably the size of a mini puzzle box. Definitely not worth the 16.00 it's listed for right now. I paid $8.00 for it and that's a decent price."
"OR";"Too big on me but the boy short style is great under your slacks or pants. Smooth, no panty lines. The fabric is really thin but rather opaque. Colors are good--flesh, nude, taupe, black. A good set."
"OR";"I have been purchasing several of these units for local customers who are retrofitting the PAR30 can lights. It is easy to install and works great with dimmer. The price is a plus too, since most kits a Home Depot or Lowe's are about $10-$20 more."
"OR";"The fit is a little off. It doesn't stay on my 6 year olds head unless she uses the mittens or we tie it like a scarf. Other then that, she's in love with it. So, I like it too."
"OR";"these are great toys, great to keep kids away from electronics and keep their hands and their minds busy.  Nice to have more than one that they can combine the snacks to make bigger creations."
"OR";"I really like these. Rounded stick that isn't too heavy and is very easy to handle. Comes in two sleeve punches that are nice to have, too. Cleans easy in the dishwasher. Glad I bought them."
"OR";"My dog is very skiddish and usually doesn't let me get close to her face, but I'm actually able to clean her teeth with this product. Easy to just rinse off while cleaning. Very happy with this product."
"OR";"This is the second pair I have purchased & I live in them 6 days a week. It was hard to get my size on the first order. They are sold in an ""E"" size, but shipped in a ""W"" size, but I will order another pair in a few years."
"OR";"I bought for myself and I love it. I got in a special deal of $80 and so happy I didn't let it pass. It's rose gold is perfect not to bright nor fated. I would recommend it. If any one is looking for a gift, this is the perfect gift for any girl."
"OR";"I used to watch the show weekly when I was younger & didn't realize how much I missed good old fashion shows. Very entertaining & brings back memories. Would recommend buying all seasons."
"OR";"This book was sooo good. It was definitely a page turner. It leaves you excited wanting more wondering what's going to happen next.  Can't wait to see what else she has in stores for us."
"OR";"I got this for my son's birthday and he loved it ! As do I, very impressed. Bigger than expected, which is what I wanted. Very soft, nice quality, cool design. Fast delivery, good packaging."
"OR";"I am really beginning to fall in love with this series. I love all the mystery and action, I just wish there was more to the relationships between characters. I want to feel a connection with Rachel, or Ivy, or any of the characters. There just isn't enough emotion from any of them. I love the story"
"OR";"Wasn't well constructed so my dog was able to eat it in one day. It did fit perfectly inside his crate but I am very disappointed that it didn't hold up to any chewing. He has toys that have lasted over 4 months so this just wasn't very durable."
"OR";"My son is thomas fan number one and this track is very happy spends hours and hours playing very shock resistant material is recommended easy to assemble very happy with what you purchased thanks"
"OR";"All Sandford's books are fun to read.  They're fast-paced, with interesting characters, good plot development and humor, and lots of twists to keep you guessing.  ""Chosen Prey"" was classic Sandford."
"OR";"The price/quality ratio is pretty good, but as is, the desk sits too low to be used by an adult. However, if you spend about $8 on table leg extensions (and all day search for the size you need) it's a good product"
"OR";"Very thin, was expecting it to be a bit thicker fabric. Had to mend it, as the side seam had a missed stitching along it. The tea-dying that I did to it worked great! I wanted it to look cream colored with ""stains"" for the costume."
"OR";"Both of my children (6 years old and 9 years old) enjoy playing this game with me. It really is easy to get the concept down and then explain to any children. They especially liked the ""jewels"" that they can earn! What a great concept."
"OR";"Would love this product if it came with a roof. My dog very quickly learned that she could climb it - and climb it she did. Wouldn't hold her for more than 5 minutes (but still a lot sturdier than the canvas pen that I purchased)"
"OR";"This is the best peeler I've ever had.  Not perfect, but really good.  The blade doesn't always return to the flat position when I'm  peeling something, but it's comfortable and sharp."
"OR";"These are SO comfortable. Like walking on a marshmallow with butter between your toes! But not quite that messy or gross. Just trust me, they are so soft and easy to wear with just about anything. I bought these in black and grey (which is actually white) and love them both!"
"OR";"My son just loves thomas, so when his train broke we had to find him a new one. Found this one on line and it was exactly like his other one. Ordered it and it arrived on time."
"OR";"Great training tool for my little puppy. She learned to walk really well with this. Only drawback is that it chafed her armpit if she pulled more. Also, would be better if the clasps were up higher rather than at the armpit. This also is what chafed her."
"OR";"This is turly the film the defines what little good (if any)that came out of the bad war. A story of the few victories the the American forces face.
Most of the battles in Vietnam were fought in back roads, and backyards, and very few large scale battles. This showed the horrible price that US troop"
"OR";"Good pocket size , not too heavy . Happy I bought it , would reccomend to any one looking for an every day carry knife,but some think its too pretty to carry"
"OR";"A great charger for my little toshiba laptop. Great at storing, & doesn't easily over heat. Highly recommended for anyone who spends a great deal of time on their laptop."
"OR";"This ball is super solid and secure in the hand.  The grip is good and tight because of the soft, yet durable, outer material.  The ball is solid construction and works absolutely great."
"OR";"This is the best treat bag ever!!!  It's easy to open and close while having both hands free.  Would definitely purchase again.  I've tried three other bags and this is the only one that is now in our home"
"OR";"I've read them all.  I've reread them all.  And I'll read them all again.  This series pulls the best of characters and plots from Stout's books, couples them with fine ensemble acting and beautiful music.  So, I've watched, watched again, and will watch some more."
"OR";"This was definitely a short story; leaving the reader wanting a few more pages to just end the curiosity of what happens next. Would recomend this to anyone looking to read a story of calling the wrong guy and then frantically searching for him."
"OR";"With 1 large dog and 3 little ones, I have to keep up with the back yard. This is the best item I have found. Easy to use, handles the 'larger' situations very well. I wouldn't order a smaller one, this is the most logical purchase."
"OR";"Higher quality then what I expected, she'll loops hold nice and tight to my 44 mag casings, pretty comfortable holster. Will buy this brand in the future when the need arises."
"OR";"This movie is great. 'Nuff said. The DVD has some really interesting extras in it where they show you the castle it was shot at and which rooms all the scenes were in.

If you are a Monty Python fan, this is a great DVD to add your collection."
"OR";"Everyone loves these unusually shaped bulbs.  We used them in a multi-light fixture in our grandson's room.  They are a  conversation piece for everyone who sees them.  Plus, they use less electricity and throw out ample light."
"OR";"Well...I saw where this was going before I'd gotten halfway through the book.  I didn't know all the details on how it would end of course, but it was pretty anticlimactic since I'd guessed the basic plot."
"OR";"I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creat"
"OR";"We went with a different set up but we are keeping these as we could use this in our kids play house. It's longer then we hoped for and a difficult application but if you need a universal bracket for the ceiling or end of window mounting this will work."
"OR";"I actually got these to use just as a pocket magnifying glass. I'm sure they're decent when attached to a camera, but they are great for viewing tiny stuff and for getting campfires started without wasting resources."
"OR";"I use it in south Asia under extreme weather conditions.
Suffice to say I have made an excellent choice depend on my work and location.

Brilliant styling as well and, great value for money."
"OR";"I like this bottle. We can both get a drink. The only thing is that they might want to do something with the doggie cup. I find my dog struggling to get a drink sometimes because of the high back on the cup. Other than that, it's a good cup."
"OR";"Interesting that Alex was the ""original pain queen"" but then gets mad at Jamie for liking when Scot does the same thing.  I love this series.  Keep them coming Nicole.  Still waiting on Rio's HEA."
"OR";"Read this for the book of the month literary class at the library.  Lawyer, over achiever, and all round rich kid loses sister.  She claimed to read a book a day in order to handle who overwhelming grief.  You decide."
"OR";"Have been a professional dog groomer for over 10 years... I decided to try this product. I must say I don't think it helps at all. It doesn't make anything worse... But it doesn't help."
"OR";"Love, love, love this coffee maker. Just as described.  Attractive on my counter top, best of all the coffee stays hot without tasting ""burned"" for at least two hours.  Easy, easy to clean."
"OR";"While this film is about a horrific time it is well done and held my interest until the connection broke down.  This is the first time that streaming has left me in a lurch and so I will return another time to watch the rest of the film."
"OR";"Perfect for us. One granddaughter loves pink, the other granddaughter loves yellow. That leaves blue one for grandmas house. Great for timing tooth brushing!"
"OR";"Beautiful. They look like much more expensive cabinets.

Want to add that this cabinet is large enough to keep many things out of sight and small enough to add to the spaciousness of the room."
"OR";"I was a media specialist/librarian for 12 years and enjoyed using this book with young students. I purchased it in board book format for my young grand daughter and I was very pleased.  Wonderful illustrations/wonderful text."
"OR";"Action figures for pool. An excellent choice. Kids love to create story lines and then act them out by throwing them into pool and then retreaving them in character. Using and developing vivid imaginations."
"OR";"Catchy title. Average book. There are some good points but the delivery is annoying. Keith has a high opinion of himself. This got in the way. I found that I didn't really like him.

I've seen Keith live and again found him too salesy."
"OR";"Works well enough. Takes a while to kick in though. A more sensitive spring would be nice... I liked that teflon tape was included. Fit and finish are very good."
"OR";"Cute little version for you and your children reading time!  I bought this one for my daughter's baby shower,
a part of a nice gift basket I made for her.  When she saw it she cried of emotion because I used to read the
same story to her when she was little and she loved it very much!"
"OR";"As much as I loved the Barnaby character and his family, I'm enjoying the ""new guy"" who I've seen on several BBC shows prior to his appearance on Midsomer Murders."
"OR";"Molded within a couple months, but I'm in Texas. Good thing it was really easy to clean and felt heavier than most of the cheap shower liners. Really worth the price."
"OR";"I liked this book, it was, just like the first one, full of many characters that could have been the murderer. It was also comical at times.

I wasn't expecting what happened the the main character, and I will continue to read this series to see what she gets into next!"
"OR";"This works great, unless you allow it to sit in pooled water.  The battery compartment will corrode quite quickly.  I brushed off the contacts with a wire brush, and elevated it.  It now works great!"
"OR";"Bought this for my daughter as an entry set for squash. She likes it. Plastic cover for case a little cheesy. If case front was solid cordura nylon it would have been 5 stars."
"OR";"These are great!  Strong, multiple sizes, very high quality.  I have bought cheap-o brands that break easily.  These seem pretty much unbreakable.  Excellent product."
"OR";"The Forgotten Jesus helped me exchange my Western viewpoint of scripture for that of a Torah-faithful Jew. Gallaty doesnt reinterpret the Bible, rather he explains the significance and symbolism of Jesus words, actions, and the Rabbinical methods of instruction he employed. By doing so, he made conn"
"OR";"Perfect fit, two seconds to put together. Great seller! Surefire is expensive but I have tried every other light on the market and nothing compares. Save where you can, don't cheap out on a light. This will last You a lifetime."
"OR";"This arrived a week earlier than I expected. YAY!!! It's wonderful. It felt like a waterbed the first time I sat  --or rather ""sank"" into it. But after a while everything worked out. It feels like a soft-medium mattress. Just wonderful."
"OR";"These shoes are extremely popular with teenagers. I've been keeping my eye out for a good deal, and it finally showed up on Amazon. They arrived on time and fit exactly as expected. Great shoes, great price and great service."
"OR";"We have a mastiff mix and this is working wonderfully on her!  I love the teaching guide and helpful training hints that came with this!!  What a great bonus! Super easy to use and very effective!  If you are debating between this one and another...this is the better choice!"
"OR";"I bought this a few months ago in preparation for a trip to Mexico. Well, I'm finally going, and just got around to setting it up. If you can call it that. If you know how to pair a Bluetooth device, you know how to use this. It's that simple. It's also small and light, so no hassle there.

I paired"
"OR";"Arrived as scheduled and store condition quality. Great price for what you get, inclusion of three chompies and missle launchers on the copter make for an amazing set for skylanders giants or general skylander fans"
"OR";"These are great, but understand they're toy soldiers for fantasy nerds.  As long as you don't expect more than you would from their green and tan counterparts, you will be pleased.  Actually, the quality is quite a bit higher."
"OR";"I redeemed points on Amazon and treated myself to this Frye bucket bag when it was massively reduced earlier in the Spring. The leather is super supple and the crossbody is a cinch to adjust (get my little joke there??). The bag has only one main compartment, but has the standard two slip pockets an"
"OR";"This little guy works pretty well!  I've had it for around two years now and it has held up to daily use in my house.  I'd definitely recommend it.  This can opener has held up better than any of the models I've owned in the past."
"OR";"A lot of play in the winder arm! The one I bought on Amazon, the arm popped out of the watch! I do not believe the hype around this Mako line. Spend a little more and get a Seiko 007."
"OR";"Didnt know this particular adapter  was  a  dish network  stick
All in all  a good value  in lieu of getting an original Panasonice stick and paying 5 times more than this one.
Glad i bought it."
"OR";"Exterior view on each handle end very poor visibly. Looks like two gears pressed together. Returning all for refund. Would work well in rental units but not for my primary residence."
"OR";"My absolute favorite thing about my new house. I have these installed in multiple rooms and I really love that I can control them on a timer or create a ""scene"".  Very convenient and really easy to install, I'd highly recommend these."
"OR";"These are the handiest hangers for drying undergarments. I absolutely LOVE them. They take up very little room and can be hung anywhere. I'm going to buy several more sets to give to my daughters."
"OR";"This ball is exactly what you'd expect from a junior ball.  The grip is good and ball bounces and handles well.  It is a great size for young players (my son it 10 and it is perfect for him)."
"OR";"This book kept me wanting more right from the first chapter. all the way till the end, I couldn't pull myself away from it. can't wait for book 6 to come out, I hope it's soon. thank you Alex for another great."
"OR";"Love love love the feeling of bamboo sheets but the fitted sheet does not fit the thicker mattress well at all. Pops off the mattress every night we've used them."
"OR";"The book pulls you in from the first page. I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day because I just couldn't stop. Once again Miss Loraine writes a book that is absolutely brilliant."
"OR";"Very good action movie they thought they could invade the USA they were wrong chuck Norris kicks but lots of over the top action you gotta love the final showdown"
"OR";"A nice turn, with a lot of Hollywoodbilila and a look into Harry Bosch's desultory past, in counterpoint to the history of the central caracter.
A good read, informative, leisurely, entertaining."
"OR";"it does the job. the fans aren't any louder than the ones built into my laptop. truthfully i can't tell the difference in the sound. i would recommend it fully. it puts the computer at the right hight and angle too."
"OR";"Excellent book. Highly recommended. Other readers had a problem with the layout of the book but I still found the though I knew that he would live the action in the story kept me engaged and still offered plenty of surprises."
"OR";"A lot of the reviews said this is smaller than they imagined, and it is.  But it still fits quite a lot and I like that all of my makeup is now in one place.  Its attractive looking and functional, so I recommend."
"OR";"Great card.  Easy install, and fits a low profile case.  No driver problems, and it just works.  I've gotten four of them so far (as we move users to dual monitors)"
"OR";"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed imp"
"OR";"Before putting this together, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SMALL SCREWDRIVER! And by small, I mean one that is 3"" or less in overall length!

With that out of the way, I love this tower!!! It looks great, works great, and is of very good quality. Well worth the money!!"
"OR";"Very good. I thought it added alot to the  story and character. It gave agood insight to what is happening. I don't usually do romance type books,but this seemed to be the rageand greatly impressed and waiting for more."
"OR";"What a great story. The chemistry between these two characters is amazing. They share something very special . The dialogue and banter is witty and fun and holds the secret to these two amazing character s-love."
"OR";"Bought this for my baby rescue squirrel. He loves it. I can always find him curled up asleep right next to it. It has also been washed and dried several times and is still holding up."
"OR";"I rated this a 5 star for several reasons:  the characters are great in their parts; it offers believable situations; and while serious, there are moments of humor.  Also, nice to watch a show that isn't overkill with violence."
"OR";"Bought this for a Christmas gift for a guy, that has everything., hoping that this will get him hooked on the series., All of Foyle's War Series is wonderful, and also, period history., you will enjoy it!!!!!  Enjoy, Paula"
"OR";"Good size and color. I love the simple look of the toy. Really no complaints other than I wish it made a couple more noises. It does chirp, gallop and neigh."
"OR";"This is a good little case for the Nuvi. I gave it 4 stars because I think it's missing some protective padding if accidentally dropped or hit.
It should come with the Garmin Nuvi and should not have to be bought separately."
"OR";"Product was made well however the bag hung too long and my 8 lb yorkie would tumble out because the sides were not sturdy enough to keep him in or to give hi."
"OR";"All of my three cats prefer other toys with feathers.  With this one they just sit there wondering what the heck it is.  It's very small and actually looks more like a hairball than a mouse, or whatever it's supposed to look like."
"OR";"Use this to store board game pieces for one of my games that has an abundance of pieces. Helps manage the pieces much easier, speeding up the process of trying to find something."
"OR";"This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I w"
"OR";"This book presents an overwhelming topic in a very non-overwhelming way.  Ten year-old Akilah finds her best friend changed when she comes back from a summer trip to Nigeria to visit her grandmother and go through a ""coming of age ceremony.""  Eventually her friend confesses that her parents took her"
"OR";"Nice product installs easy works well look stylish and well made, i would buy it again but it is so well made there is no need to."
"OR";"My 3 year old grandson loved the large train putting the cow out to pasture and taking food to the store. I was disappointed it didn't fit his Thomas and Brio train track."
"OR";"Oh my gosh, my grandson loved this puzzle!  He will turn 4 soon and this one kept him thinking.  He loved the size and the subject!
This is a great buy!"
"OR";"I loved this 7th. book in this series.  These books are so much fun. The characters are believable, and well written.  I enjoy the suspense that keeps you wondering until the very end of the book. This is a quick read, but VERY satisfying, and I can't wait for book number eight!!"
"OR";"First time using the Inov-8 in any kind of shoe and loved them. Grip is fantasitc and works perfect for all squating and OLY lifts. Good thing about this show is that they have more flex in the shoe which allows for use in different workouts as well."
"OR";"I bought these for my office which has windows that are very awkward in size. I did really like the curtains, although they didn't really look like the picture when they were hung. The only thing I really didn't like was the ""moss"" color; it was not flattering at all."
"OR";"Exactly what I wanted.  My old sifter was the squeeze handle type and around 52 years old.  Right now using that type is difficult.  This is compact and works perfectly plus you get the plastic lids."
"OR";"This book is exciting and daring!! I don't think I could do what she did and not know the person but it was a great book and I just couldn't put it down now I'm off to read part two!!!"
"OR";"I get a lot of compliments on this dress. The fabric is hefty and good quality so I am able to wash on my own and put in dryer and it has held up to the wear and wash. That's a plus for me as I don't get to the dry cleaners that often."
"OR";"I do a lot of woodworking and many operations require eye protection.  I wear glasses and this item works very well with them.  It is fairly comfortable and you can swing the face plate up and out of the way when you need to."
"OR";"Highly recommend this toy for kitten or playful cat. Our kitten loves it, she chases around for either one of the feather refills. We love playing with her and see her so intense into playing with it."
"OR";"This wheel is preferred over others by our two mice...have bought them over and over and over.  Hamsters in the past liked the bigger one as well.  Sometimes a little noisy, but not too much...and it doesn't bother us at all anyway."
"OR";"I'm used to the old LBE style so I was a bit hesitant about buying this newer version. I really like it! It was in really good condition and works perfectly."
"OR";"Not as great as some of the hype but still a good movie with some added in obvious comedy. Some of the special affects seemed cheesy when it came to people being hit by bullets but all in all I will keep the DVD"
"OR";"Its about time Mr. Woods wrote an original story, I've read all of the Stone B. books and the last few were all rehashes of the same story. Thank you for something new."
"OR";"Really saves your back by not having to bend over. Plus, if you hit like I do (which isn't to good), the balls are scattered all over the place. Made it much easier to collect them and start hitting again."
"OR";"Awesome for hydraulic fittings or odd sizes so you don't have to carry a big wrench rack. Fits on better then ANY wrench since the jaws close parallel to each other. Great feel in the hand. The quality is there."
"OR";"Fun reward type toy.  I don't think it would hold up very well with unsupervised use.  My guy like to chew the rope and would make it just a ball (without rope) in short order."
"OR";"I loved all the Wilder Sisters books... so well written and so nice to eat a clean romance! I highly recommend this series,
Carol aka froggie"
"OR";"I find myself thinking I wasted my time with this book. a zombie novel is about zombies. this book misled me into thinking I would read more action. I ended up getting the baby and the dog, Bos Bos"
"OR";"I bought this cable to replace the one that came with my Sony Portable drive.  The mailman left the package on the front lawn and my dog ripped it to shreds.  This cable works perfectly with my drive."
"OR";"I have been using a hand grinder for years, but it had a difficult time cutting through venison sinew.  Then I bought this ... cuts through all the cuts of meat with ease.  Wish I had bought one years ago."
"OR";"My dog seemed to really love these treats.  I don't really buy lamb flavored food or treats that often so this was a difference.  He loved it!  Nice and tasty!"
"OR";"This was a short story with a very well thought out story line.  I was kept in suspense till the end and felt that it had quite a punch to it. The main character made me wonder what he would do next.
If you get a chance I recommend that you check it out."
"OR";"Don't waste your time with this one.  With all the good books out there to be reading there is really no reason to waste your time with this mediocre outing.  The main character is dull, the story is predictable, the plot is weak, and all in all a waste of time."
"OR";"Wow, talk about fast paced, this book was really good & I liked it.  One thing about money......greed, deceit, murder & scheming is sure to follow & this book had it all."
"OR";"Unlike any minister I have ever met. He has faults, drinks, loves women, yet is true to his beliefs. The mysteries were not easy to solve. For each one, I thought I had it figured out. For each one, I was wrong. Entertaining, engaging."
"OR";"Very nice, different and attractive. recieved several compliments,  Sleves a little short for a tall person. I'm 6'4"". Might want to get a size larger unless you are a small person."
"OR";"A few new plot twists and a great love story. I would recommend this book to any one who enjoy a good romance  and shifter story."
"OR";"My children really enjoy doing all math books in this series and get excited when they get a new one.  This book helped revive my special needs daughter's interest in math - it is great to see her enjoying her school work again."
"OR";"Got this for my 1 year old daughter. It is super soft. She loves laying  on it and playing with it. 4 stars because one of the antenna balls fell off and I had to sew it back on. Could be a choking hazard."
"OR";"Sadly I have to say that the first person writing of this story was just monotonous.  I really tried to get into the story and did,  here and there,  but only to be pulled down by the dreary first person story telling that was almost fanatic in its embracing  of ""I."" It was just too much."
"OR";"This is not your typical hot read. I couldn't put it down. Complex characters, thrilling plot, and an ending with a twist. This is one of Alexx's best!  Grabs you by the throat with the first line."
"OR";"Out of most of the things I have bought on Amazon I would recommend you buy this one the most. Only gripe I have is the Android wear app, there are no third party apps available yet for thinking this device to your phone"
"OR";"Easy pan to flip Really great nonstick. I would have liked a few more recipes but it seems to be more intuitive than stick to a precise recipe. Just learn a method and change it up according to what you want to use."
"OR";"I tried it once and as soon as was able I bought it. It is a bright portrait and street lens. It focuses very fast and has a nice bokeh. It is light, you don't even feel it in your camera! This lens is a must in your bag."
"OR";"Good read, good storyline, good book to make people think. The characters learn to grow and make you think. Worth the read."
"OR";"I bought a large and it fits a little tighter than I expected.  Not as loose as the picture on the model.  I guess if I'm swimming in it that will actually be a good thing.  Haven't had it in the water yet."
"OR";"My GSDs like these, and they last sufficiently long, even with their rough and constant play.  (One bit the dust, but other is still kicking after a few months).  Dogs really like how this bounces when thrown.  We have several of these squeakers."
"OR";"This is a much nicer although more expensive desk lamp than the one sold by Taotronics.  This metal lamp has a nice quality feel to it.  Pay a little more and get this one."
"OR";"I was caught up from the very first book. This series was exciting, filled with drama and made me cry along the way. Ms. Shan, u did that. Also, I love happy endings."
"OR";"A must see Movie! It was exciting, exhilarating, interesting and had a great plot. You get to see J-Lo like you have never seen her before and Jason Statham is in his element and keeps you on the edge of your seat with the action."
"OR";"The knife lives in the door pocket of my car. I've used it a few times. I give it a 4 because the fire stick is not very good compared to others I've purchased. Otherwise, it is simply what you expect."
"OR";"The air pump is use less. You can barely get 20psi in a tire. And it doesn't fit in the bag. The bag is difficult to strap under the seat. The multi-tool is the only good thing about the kit. Wasted my money."
"OR";"This is a rivetting book and hard to put down.  It would make a great motion picture.  Not only is the story compelling but I learned so much about art restoration.  The book is very well researched. There are a number of emotional issues which are well drawn.  Kudos."
"OR";"Bought used but works fine with some signs of wear. By good wire and welding is much better. Runs much hotter than expected for 110V weld machine."
"OR";"I love these shoes. Cheap, comfortable and fitting all outfits. I solved the issue of no arch support and the shoe being slightly bigger (reported by other customers) by putting the extra insert in over the other one. Now I can walk to work no problem."
"OR";"After 5 months my wife's ring is holding strong! She likes it, I tried to replace it with a more expensive CZ ring and she didn't like it and wanted to go back to this one."
"OR";"When it comes to keeping our baby chicks alive, a good quality heat lamp is absolutely necessary for 24/7 temperature control. I would recommend this bulb to anyone."
"OR";"I really enjoy this series about Duncan Dewar.  He is a marvelous character with a witty sense of humor.  His family members show up in the story and they're all likable and real seeming.  I look forward to the next book in this series."
"OR";"I purchased one of these to replace an error prone WD Caviar.  Less than a day after installing it in my desktop I ordered another one for my Mac Book Pro.  The difference is so amazing I will never use another magnetic drive.  Prices are dropping weekly!  Just do it you won't regret it.  Win7/64 am"
"OR";"Was really attracted to the nice, clean, fun, organized look of this book, and I really appreciated all the tips inside to help declutter fairly easily and quickly to boot!  The pictures were also a nice touch."
"OR";"Excellent -- very good small-scale adjustment gear.

This is about what I expect from Irwin clamps these days. Great price for a high-quality product that will last way past its price-point for durability."
"OR";"great headphones. sounds good and loud as I like it. a must buy!!! the headphones comes with three different size rubbers and a case for storage very nice."
"OR";"I bought this doll as gift for one of my little nieces, she loved it.  I loved the way she looked that I bought the other dolls for her collection and hours of pretend play.  Looking forward to the new dolls of Ever After High!"
"OR";"Their are three different stories in this book. The first is stand alone but the last two are related. I really enjoyed all three stories and would recommend you try them."
"OR";"I love this movie, however, don't order it from tfmnow4433.  Bad customer service to say the least.  This movie is exciting, modern, different, and revolutional in the superhero world"
"OR";"These are some of the most comfortable tape I have used and the the price is great. You can adjust how much cushion by how tight you pull as you wrap. They are much easier to work with than more expensive cork tape from Specialize."
"OR";"Great paddle! Very light-weight and sturdy. It is much more easy to use than the paddle that came with my paddle board. It is also easy to adjust or take apart and even came with a great carrying case."
"OR";"Love this. One of the few organic cat foods. All seven of the cats in my house like this. Plus with Newman's products a portion of the proceeds always go to charity."
"OR";"It goes with the soundtrack CD I purchased. Didn't care for it and probably won't ever watch it again. Predictable, not a great transfer to DVD. Tried to enjoy it, surprised Anthony Quinn took the part."
"OR";"I doubt anyone will ever write better horse-stories than Walter Farley; kids love them, and I'd rate them equal to ""Treasure Island"" or ""The Jungle Book"" as far as entertainment value."
"OR";"As per usual Erin McCarthy wrote another winner. I would recommend this book highly as one of the best books I have read this year."
"OR";"I decided to come back to Steinbeck after reading a couple of his works years ago.  I find his writing easy to get my head into. Not all of his works are depressing like some people think.  Cannery Row is quite humorous, in fact."
"OR";"This is my 1st inline filter. My TDS reading was 156 ppm before I installed the Woder 10K-Gen 3. After a few weeks of use the reading is 65 ppm. That's better than some spring water."
"OR";"Clever techy stories, though sometimes the technical facts do not agree with the writer's imagination.  Really like actors and characters they play.  Charlie is our favorite - what a nice nerd."
"OR";"Excellent survival knife especially for the price. Arrived pretty sharp. You can always make a knife sharper but this one is pretty good right out of the box. You won't be disappointed."
"OR";"I guess you really do get what you pay for!  These pads were inexpensive compared to some others and I won't buy them again because they are ""too"" thin and the pet urine leaks right through.  I use them with my sturdier pads most of the time."
"OR";"item as describe my daughter will be very happy . thank you for your usual good job in seller and shipping item like this.
the boy of this series why are so expensive, I hope that Ill found the boy  in the future with the right price."
"OR";"I really liked this remake.  the use of the arid scenery was great contrast to the actors.  the few twist changes brought new life to this updated version.  yes, I still love the original too."
"OR";"This is a very, very sharp, very handy knife. I don't use it for paring (as I am not fond of serrated knives for that). I use it as a utility knife for any miscellaneous use. Seems like it will stay sharp for a long time. Well made."
"OR";"Having read only two of the precious Penn Cage books, it took a while to fall into line with the plot.  However, this begs for a Penn Cage Book 6, and I wonder if that will be the end of the series???"
"OR";"Glad I bought it, perfect for around the house, would not use it on a construction site though, as it is a little light weight. But it all works fine. Drill has nice feel to it and saw plows thru wood with ease,"
"OR";"Fits as listed, comfortable fit, but man they are stiff in the sole. You won't be breaking in the sole action for some time. Nice shoe though, I really like them for the occasional shop visit when I have toe up."
"OR";"Buck has been a name you could trust in knives for as long as I can remember. I am happy to see that the quality of their products have remained consistent over the years. Still made in USA.  The Lancer is small like I wanted & very sturdy."
"OR";"I'm afraid it wouldn't last long - wires are too thin they should be made to be more durable! The main idea of buying this item was to replace the other set one ear bud of which failed after about one year of use because of the same problem ...."
"OR";"Tried it once. I have no idea if this works as well as people claim. But I laughed my ass off at Milo. He looked like I was trying to kill him. It was hilarious! The comedic factor alone is enuf to give this 5 stars!"
"OR";"Definitely some hot steamy scenes in this one -- but the constant Bea negativity was wearing on me.  Maybe if I was in her stilettos I may have felt the same way.  Nevertheless, good story -- hot characters."
"OR";"I bought a M and it was difficult to get on and off. It might've been okay had there been any areas with velcro/zipper/buttons/etc. that opened up on the bodice to give you some wiggle room. I usually buy mediums and wear a size 6, if that helps at all with sizing. It was fine once I got it on, but "
"OR";"I love the high quality of this, cleans very easily as well. Has a good weight to and shoots the minced garlic out nicely without even needing a ton of pressure."
"OR";"Looks great with the matching Puppia harness and just like the harness, it seems very well made. Length is just about perfect for walking my cat or should I say for my cat to walk me."
"OR";"Got this for my son who will be a ring bearer in a wedding, Fits perfect and so adorable! It runs true to size for an average size 4.
The only con is the shirt is a bit short, but not a deal breaker."
"OR";"for the price, this is a good set.
i can't tell more expensive ones from less, so price is a good sorting tool for me.
really only wanted the UV for protecting my lens anyway."
"OR";"As the title says, it's very versatile. Very well thought out and well made too which I expect nothing less from BCM. Also a lot better looking than many options out there."
"OR";"I have bought new bal sneaks before and always get EE for larger toe box. These are wider than over the whole length of the shoe than I recall which makes them look big and clownish."
"OR";"I absolutely loved this book!  I was amazed at how well written this was! Five star for certain!  Beautiful. Just beautiful.  I recommend this to anyone and everyone. Sarah Prineas is one special lady.  I can't wait for the next two books!!!!"
"OR";"This movie was perfect for my sisters and I to watch especially because we were watching while stuck in our house due to Hurricane Harvey #HoustonStrong.  Prior to this I had not seen the movie so it was awesome that the movie was available to watch."
"OR";"As described.  Heavy Duty,  Sturdy,  Stable,  Nice Clean Smooth Cuts.  Couldn't  be happier...
A DIY'er must have...
Be sure to have the correct Auger before Buying.  There is one available from this same brand name,"
"OR";"This is my third one. I lost the other two. I carry it all the time. Very useful. I use the file as a light weight flat head screw driver in a pinch. The plastic tooth pick is a must for me."
"OR";"Large capacity.  Will keep stuff hot/cold for a long time.  Satisfied customer here.  Worth the price I think though I wish it was a little cheaper since these are consumables."
"OR";"Been using this over a year now, and have not had any problems.

We use with bagels, toast, open faced sandwiches, reheating dishes, reheating bread sticks, pizza, etc.

This things works great :)"
"OR";"I own many of these products they all work great. the tungsten 2 inch wheels are wonderful they work better than a hungry beaver. use them to do lots of detail work . wonderful product keep up the good work king arthur."
"OR";"Solid build quality, works very well for cooking things like spaghetti. I also use it for random noodle dishes and so on. The locking lid works very well, fits securely and makes draining very easy and effortless."
"OR";"So much fun!  Lots of color and fun shapes and subject matter...........the whole family came together around this puzzle!  It's big, bright and quality materials."
"OR";"Seems like a good variation on the sex in space stories that are out there right now. Featuring 3 humans  including a smart heroine made this a good read"
"OR";"Things that are terrifying or filled with sadness are not necessarily without beauty. The Book Thief is a story that exemplifies that principle. The characters are real and complex and the plot is captivating. But more than that, it's a book that shows the humanity of different individuals, while no"
"OR";"We have one of these in our child's room - it's a nice level for providing navigation and anti-monster light without being too bright.  They're light weight and durable so the other is in our travel kit and gets used in hotel rooms when we're on the road."
"OR";"Our 8 y.o. son bought these with his birthday money and he was so excited when he get them. He didn't know that they came in so many colors, that was a HUGE plus! He's beyond happy with his new Nerf ammo!"
"OR";"**update**  So 3 hours after getting these headphones I was listening to them as I was charging them, and I got up having 1 side in a ear and SNAP!!!! They pulled apart with ease..... I was immediately saddened and in disbelief. Especially because I was loving them sooo much but now it makes me wond"
"OR";"If you are looking for a fun movie with singing and dancing then this is the movie for you.  It isn't out in Blu Ray though so don't try looking because I have.  Showed it to 7th grade, inter city students and they loved it!"
"OR";"This is my 2nd pair of Blundstone boots.  My other pair is model BL558.  Both pairs are the most comfortable boots ever.  No break-in period - they are perfect right out of the box.  Good quality leather and well made.  Highly recommend."
"OR";"Great bottle for 4 1/2 year old to take to school. Durable and great color. Only good for cold water though per instruction manual"
"OR";"I purchased this because we use it for sensory play with my son.  He has just recently started experimenting with PlayDoh.  It seems like it isn't the quality of what I grew up with but still a good product."
"OR";"Terrific bargain. Exactly the right color shown in pic. The hardest part was removing it from the box. I was able to attach the legs and set it up fairly easy. Sturdy product. Works well on our office/entertainment/spare room."
"OR";"Really like it; then it started to sound crackly at times like a loose connection. The sound would disappear, but I'd fiddle with the connection and it would come back.
Now it's gone -- no light, no sound.

Not very durable."
"OR";"Love this figure! I gotta tell you, I have nothing bad to say about this figure. Finally,  this is IMO the best snake out ever! Get it while the price is low because I see this going up."
"OR";"I have two under nine pound inside kitties...no scratching...no fleas! Need I say more? Have used Advantage since they were kittens and now the oldest is almost seven and the youngest close to two. It's a great product!"
"OR";"Rabbie has no problem explaining his problems, perhaps no, but I canna abide being in the same room with you and no speaking to you, aye? Ive thought of naugh but you, Bernadette, he muttered. I canna sleep, I canna eat. I liked this book, I loved Rabbie"
"OR";"Had great humor that my young kids 3,5,8 were able to understand and laugh at but also some adult humor that they didn't (thankfully) get. Worth the watch especially if you have ever bad a cat in your life."
"OR";"What can you say about this....it was basically new and it came with the orginal box and all the connections not bad for a used item I got it for my mom she wanted something to watch movies on I got her a Bluetooth keyboard with it and she's happy."
"OR";"I loved book 2 as much as book 1. The love that blooms between Oleg and Nadja was sexy and sweet. Nadja's  family on the other hand was horrific."
"OR";"Installed it myself. It works great. I really like it when I can go to my phone or computer and change the temperature when I am away from the house. It also sends me texts or e-mails when the temperature goes above or below a programed temp that I selected."
"OR";"I KEPT HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY BIKE NEEDING AIR IN ONE OF MY TIRES EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS SO I FIGURED I HAD A SLOW LEAK. BOUGHT THIS TUBE AND NOW I""M CRUISING ON MY BIKE WITH NO HASSLES."
"OR";"I never, never rate a novella this high. They are usually too short with the story stopping abruptly. Not this book. The characters are so believable and the writing so clever that you feel as though you are actually in the moment. I was truly enchanted."
"OR";"The video of Murder She Wrote, the complete 11th series is is wonderful and a quality product. I will purchase from this seller again any time I need something that they are selling. The product is of a high quality."
"OR";"Love the shirt, but i definitely ordered a size too big! These shirts normally have a loose fit to them, making them a little larger than usual. Other than that, amazing light feel!"
"OR";"Great way to connect Lanyards, not a real buckle, they do not come apart easily and are designed to break away at 20lbs,,, make your lanyards to go on and off over your head without the connectors unconnecting."
"OR";"This handy gadget works really well for filling plastic storage bags, even with soup.  They also worked great for drying my rubber gloves.  The folding feature is really nice for storage of the tool."
"OR";"Great little bookshelf. All of the holes lined up fine and there was no extra hardware! The rocket and all of the details are actually carved in and painted decently well. There are a few paint blemishes but overall really well done!"
"OR";"We looked everywhere in stores for a product like this with no luck.  Thankfully we found it online. It is precisely what we needed to give some more hanging space in the closet. The product is durable and priced reasonably."
"OR";"Nice and sturdy, and the size and shape comes in handy when a 1-cup is too small.  Easy to read markings.  Haven't used the strainer yet, but it may come in handy down the road."
"OR";"This bridge is a great edition to any Thomas train set.my kids love it and the quality is great. This is still in great condition despite all the rough play that it undergoes."
"OR";"It's perfect!  Not such a big holding area that you have to dig around for your items.  Perfect for the wallet, cell phone, comb and other necessary items.  Need one like it in a summer color for that season."
"OR";"I now have 3 of these in my basement  so handy and cheaper then installing more outets for lightes down there. One would do but with three helps with keeping spiders at bay. These are great for outside evening /night events."
"OR";"For having some generally good actors in it, I must say that the script and acting of the movie are probably the worst I have ever seen... But on a good note the shipping was fast and Amazon's service is great.  Just a terrible flick."
"OR";"These water buffalo tails are very much loved by my little Maltese. They provide quite a bit of chewing fun for him, and appear to be good quality (sorry but I was not willing to taste). There are quite a few in the sack, so pretty good value here."
"OR";"The ""case"" is a little tricky to open at first but once you get on to it, is simple.  Like that it protects the lamp and takes up far less room than most Coleman's that come in a hard sided case."
"OR";"This is my second Anker battery charger.  I usually carry one in my truck and car.  Always handy when electrical outlets are not available or easy to get to. Makes a great gift to those who have lots of electronic toys."
"OR";"Loved the first three volumes of this series and couldn't wait to watch this one.  Just as good as what's come before and and very enjoyable.  Can't wait to watch Volume 5!!!"
"OR";"SO comfortable and easy to slip on. Great quality and color. I wear a size 8 in most shoes and typically size up for flats, I ordered size 8 in these and they are perfect!"
"OR";"Yes, I found this book impossible to put down.  I loved it, and think Ozzy is an insane idiot after reading it.  But, I would love to have dinner with he and his wife now, and I never would have thought that before."
"OR";"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees"
"OR";"After reading Peter Diamandis, Ray Kurzweil, several other books about now and future this book looked redundant. But is not. Speaks about daily stuff but puts clarity on it. At the end...a joy of reading, morever because is very, scarily...current."
"OR";"Excellent Movie. Either this movie was made for these characteres, or these characters were made for this movie.
I'm a long time Westerns fan, and this was superbly done. Should have won  (more?) awards."
"OR";"Very well made ladder and a great value. The pads on the ladder legs are substantial, as are the locking braces. Much higher quality than a same - priced competing model by another brand."
"OR";"I wanted a silverware tray that was cheap in price, but good in quality.

I put this in my kitchen drawer backward, so the junk compartment is to the front, but the spoons, etc., are still in easy reach.

I'm glad I got it."
"OR";"An excellent book.  Really well written, carefully sourced; a pleasure to read, as well as being very informative.  It really put an enormous amount of the news about China over the course of the past couple decades into perspective for me."
"OR";"I had one of the units for a year and put over 2000 miles on it before I dropped it on the pavement and the display broke. So, I bought another and I hope I won't drop this one. Unit could be made more rugged."
"OR";"Great read. Yuval has done a great job in presenting the facts and simulating the imagination while reading. I'vent finished it yet ... half way so far... but I'm already thinking about getting the next book from this writer."
"OR";"Well made, works a lot easier for getting the backstrap pin out of my glock 30 a lot easier than the tool provided. It's also just handy to have in the range bag. It's a great tool, get it and you won't be disappointed."
"OR";"I use these for mountain biking and the sound quality is adequate. The thing I really like about these is the ability to hear ambient noised. They are NOT sound isolating like most ear buds and that's exactly what I like about them."
"OR";"I wanted a quick refresher to Greek mythology and this book did that for me. It's informative without being way too long. I also learned a few new things in there that I didn't know before. The stories are just fascinating to me."
"OR";"Nice bra, not great fit (slightly small).  Not great support - this isn't an every day bra.  I got it for under a specific shirt and for that limited purpose, it's good.  If I was ordering again, I would go up one band size."
"OR";"I watched this drama last year on Dramafever, loved it, still loving it. Lee Jun Ki is a remarkable actor, in fact all the actors were very good. I enjoy the era timeframe of this drama."
"OR";"There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well a"
"OR";"This is a revolutionary product that is changing the way I manage my energy use at home.
And it's a beautiful art piece that replaces that old yellowing piece of plastic that's been sitting on the wall since 1977."
"OR";"Doggy toys, just make sure you remove the electronic part with the battery before they swallow it. That is if your dog is a chew monster like mine. This is a good rule for all dog toys with batteries or electronics."
"OR";"I love Angela Lansbury as Jessica Fletcher.  The stories are well written and riveting.  Anyone who enjoys a good story without blood, guts and sex should enjoy this.  It is really decent entertainment, and sooo enjoyable."
"OR";"Amazing company with very hire standards.  We needed help with using the product and they were extremely helpful.  I would definitely recommend this awesome car and will definitely buy again from this seller."
"OR";"I have had these for a while now and I got to say I love the bass on these earbuds. I don't like paying a lot for earbuds since I have bad luck in getting them crushed or snagged on something. I would definitely buy another pair of these."
"OR";"Although this is a great toy for an older child, I wasn't aware it had to be built. I didn't read it or they didn't describe as such)  I sent it back as my grandson is four and not into ""building"" things just yet."
"OR";"This case has extra soften material inside that provides excellent protection for the mac. Compare with another similar case that I bought before, this case is the best one for the price and for the design."
"OR";"My 10 year old loves this. He's becoming quite the master. Crashed quite a few times, nothing broken so far. I would say it's a great beginner."
"OR";"Very nice case. I bought it to store my automotive scanner in. Fast delivery, good quality, pretty good price. Cant go wrong."
"OR";"Good thing I bought this extra track to go with the Pennsylvania train set I bought my grandson for his birthday, otherwise the train would have just travelled in a tight circle. Now it goes quite a long way. He loves it."
"OR";"Very Tarantino style film.  Entertaining, funny and keeps you paying attention.  Hated to see one character get bumped off, but the one who got it deserved it... Highly recommended."
"OR";"i have used this item almost for 8 months now, i work at a very large shipyard as a welder and i found my self needing a lot of tools and odds and ends on me at all times, but my pocket became so unorganized and would on occasion cut my hand from random things in my pocket, so i decided to buy this."
"OR";"This bracelet is very pretty and shiny.  It seems awfully light and fragile.  I expected it to be a little heavier and more substantial.  It is to be a gift and I will be happy to give it and hope that the recipient gets a lot of wear and enjoyment out of it."
"OR";"I only use these to spread glue. I tried to use them for painting and staining and it was a mess. Lots of hair kept coming out and they don't spread very well. For the price you can't beat it though. Arrived on time."
"OR";"This is a really nice slipcover that saved a chair that has good ""bones"" but aestheticly needed help.thank you Amazon for the great price and fast delivery. It's exactly what we needed."
"OR";"OMG - I LOVE this carry on - it has way more room than one would think! I haven't tried it at the airport yet so I don't know if I will have any issues since it is wider but it is a keeper regardless."
"OR";"These work wonderful with my Westone UM2 headphones.  Great price and excellent value.  Would recommend this for anyone that would want to replace their earphone tips."
"OR";"Not a big trekkie, but really enjoyed season one.  It's great science fiction with likable characters, good plots, and good special effects.  The pilot is ok, but it really takes off from about episode 3 on."
"OR";"Got a lot of use out of this one.  It can be attached to pretty much anything and we used it to attach our son's teethers, toys, bottles and sippies to his stroller.  Highly recommended."
"OR";"This series of publications cannot be beat if you want to delve deep into the Bard's plays but have hesitated because of the old English. You read the new then the old and now you get it! After a while you find that you hardly need the translation any more."
"OR";"Great product. Lots of fun. Our boy could let it down. The sounds and ease of operation was great. Five stars and two thumbs up. Did anybody notice how inexpensive this is?"
"OR";"I bought one last year for like 5bucks, and somehow a seller is listing it for 99cents so I bought 4!

But then the price went back up, I hate to put shopping bag on the ground, even at home, or in my own car."
"OR";"They were ok. Big pack of mini plastic horses. You can tell they are cheap. Worked well enough for table decor for daughters birthday. All wouldn't stand. A couple could not balance."
"OR";"Awesome little lantern - seems well built and very bright.  Time will tell, but for the price this is a great lantern.  I wish it had a handle on the top, but otherwise really like all the features. Enjoy.

Update: Just bought another one!"
"OR";"Used this for terrariums, nice dark rich color and it was a decent price
I know there are other kinds and probably cheaper versions at Big box stores but it was nice to get all of my terrarium supplies from the comforts of home!!"
"OR";"This is a great product that provides precision drilling for a good price. The vise (Proxxon 28132) is a must. The unit is compact. Even after reading other reviews about the size, when the box arrived it was smaller than anticipated. That said, it has more than exceeded expectations."
"OR";"This is one toy that my 4. 5yr old and 2. 5yrs old play with everyday. It even holds up to 200lbs. I did replace the wheels with Polyurethane wheels, it makes them so much smoother and faster."
"OR";"The dress was not as nice as I thought it would be from the picture.  It runs very large on top, I am going to take it in to get fitted...overall, it looks much CHEAPER than what the picture shows..."
"OR";"Costume is adorable.  I wish the ears stood up a little better.  I'm going to have to reinforce them.  Otherwise an awesome costume.  My daughter is a 6x. And the 7-8 fits great"
"OR";"This didn't work for my son's coffee pot so I should have ready a little deeper. He is in Germany and I sent this to him. It works fine for his phone and laptop but I had to order a heavier duty one for the coffee pot."
"OR";"This book is way too long and confusing. It has too many characters and some characters have similar names which makes it even more confusing. It's neither a mystery or a ghost story like it's been described. I just don't understand how it won  the Booker prize."
"OR";"What a perfect ending to a great series. Full of excitement not knowing who was good or bad. You need to read this from the beginning to understand the story tho but won't dissapoint"
"OR";"Beware if you are a parent of a younger child.  Not sure exactly who this is geared for?  Maybe older kids and adults very into dark steampunk-style?
We knew we were in trouble when one of the first scenes the mid-wife going to deliver Jack offered the mother whiskey?  This was originally a French m"
"OR";"I can't praise these enough; they are sturdy, rigid, well made and do the job really well for screws, electronics or whatever small items you have. I'll be buying more!"
"OR";"I ABSOLUTELY loved this book, it was different from what I had expected. It was my first book to read from Carol Godwin, and definitely not my last. Just enough paranormal and romance combined."
"OR";"I think it's a cute children's book. Unfortunately it portrays big cities as a chaotic place and doesn't show the beauties of the city. Well, it's ok, my child still enjoys it."
"OR";"My youngest son loves this outfit. It has a loop to hold the sword and has held up to a few battles with shrubbery (dragons). Its a nice purchase if your kid is slashing rubber swords a lot. This makes it look official."
"OR";"magnet doesn't have much strength so really cant be used that way,I was going to send it back until I found a way to wedge it into a cupboard and now its a wee bit better,the alarm works well and is easy to use"
"OR";"Purchased two of these in different sizes. All clad makes great quality stainless steel cooking and bakeware and these are no exception. Heavy and durable, I expect it to last my lifetime or longer."
"OR";"This is one of the first books that really made me sleep cause is only about a girl with insaecurity issues that overcomes it with boobs to become a slut or person who used his boobs to go forward (in the book only talked of the process to buy her boobs)."
"OR";"Awesome Easter gift for our 9 year old daughter.  We looked in the stores but the prices varied or they were out of stock.  This is the playdoh we grew up with, and a cute way for today's generation to enjoy playing with it."
"OR";"The title sure had me fooled, but fully understand the reason once I read the book.  Craig Johnson hits another five-star winner on my growing list of everything he's written."
"OR";"I mistakenly purchased this slightly bigger than I needed to( I am petite in size) but I didn't return it as it is not overly big that I cannot wear it. Excellent material and color  true royal blue. I am satisfied with this purchase."
"OR";"Bought this for my wife. This is the fifth shoe i bought this year for her.
Despite wearing the same size, this shoe is a bit wider on the front making it unstable.

End up buying kayano 20 and it fit perfectly (all medium wide)"
"OR";"Beautiful product, I just loved it! Definitely very well done carving job on the Tiger eye and I was really impressed by that!!! I want buy more in the future and give them like a gift for my loved ones. Worth every single penny!!"
"OR";"I think it should be mentioned that I received a package of these in a ziploc sandwich bag.  They are not bright and shiny like the picture but dull.  I'm not sure why these are being sold this way but I had to return the one ziploc bag I did receive"
"OR";"My kids are loving this toys, it's very cute!  We bought this set for our kids to play with their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Train-Tracks-Complete-Set/dp/B00ZEBMTZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Train Tracks Complete Set</a>.  They're both are NOT related"
"OR";"Strap part is just about 40""(maximum), plus the swivels at each end.  I have Remington 870(tactical) with Blackhawk adjustable stock, and sling is perfect at 38"".  I am skinny though.

I think the quality is great for the price.  It certainly look great."
"OR";"I haven't read a book I couldn't put down in a long time! After reading Imhotep, then this book, I am looking forward to book 3. It was exciting, terrifying, funny and mystical. If you love history, adventure and intrigue, you will really enjoy this series."
"OR";"I like that these don't burn really quickly and the price was decent for the quantity (and array of colors) that I received. My only complaint is that they're still a little large for my chime holders so I gotta twist them in a bit."
"OR";"I really like this light.  The only thing I wish they would change is the cord placement.  It sticks out the side so it is more visible in my situation then I would prefer.  Other than that, it operates properly, the switch is good quality, and it works perfect with our terrarium."
"OR";"These slippers are for my husband.  We ordered a size 13; but, they're slightly too small and too narrow.  Hopefully, they will loosen some over the coming weeks.  However, for the price, we expected more.  We would not buy these again."
"OR";"Cuts very smooth, high quality dadoes. Included shim set is a nice extra. Case is cardboard but still functional. As a long-time woodworker, I would recommend."
"OR";"I work on alot of computers for people. Never went wrong with APC batteries. Fast shipping and a genuine replacement part. APC has a good reputation and couldn't be happier with my purchase.."
"OR";"This is a quality looking piece of furniture.  Easy to mount and holds a good amount of weight.  Size is capable of holding 4-5 pieces of AV equipment and a good amount of wires behind it."
"OR";"Ok, I'm putting I don't like it because I watched it 2 weeks ago and I've already forgotten everything about it. So I must not have liked it. I only know it was in sub-titles. Can't remember a single other thing."
"OR";"I've loved everything I've read by Bella and these keep that the same. I can't believe it's taken me this long to read these amazing stories. 5* for all these stories."
"OR";"This thing is quality. The weight is perfect, just heavy enough to prove its granite, but not too heavy. It grinds things to a pulp! There is some dust when you first use it, but just grind itself under water for a little while, let it dry out, and you are good to go."
"OR";"I have a wide variety of kids through my home for daycare or after-school play, and this works for a range of ages/interests.  Also take it along when we visit relatives, it has been enjoyed by the young and the not-so-young. Very cute and fun."
"OR";"The product looks much smaller in the picture, I really wanted a much smaller version of this considering how sleek and well put it looks. The design is amazing, however the bag was very much bigger than expected, so its useless to me."
"OR";"This is a great harness for dogs that need adjustment around the neck, like my little dog.  Very few dog harnesses do that, only one adjustment around their body, and that's all.  These are great, and will buy more in the future for sure.  Thanks seller."
"OR";"This was a Christmas gift for my 8 year old granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! It is such a great value and is perfect for beginning or intermediate young fashionistas! I am so pleased with this purchase!!"
"OR";"We bought 30 of these for the kitchen in our new home.  They are solid and look great on our cabinets. I suggest with all cabinet knobs/handles that you use a little lockttie on the screws so they stay snug."
"OR";"Hard to get into.  Not liking the ideal of female Jesus he was born in this earth as a man of God.  Why change the truth for a book?  The message was to learn forgiveness and a great way of teaching this."
"OR";"Love this necklace. It's sophisticated and does NOT look gaudy. I'm no gem expert, but as a regular person, it doesn't scream ""fake"" and can be worn without looking ostentatious, too.  I like that you can adjust the length by about 2""."
"OR";"This book was long and slow to start.  It seemed to take forever to start the actual explanation.  But if you persevere it is worth it.  Those enjoy history will enjoy the book.  I am amazed that anyone could serve what these men went through."
"OR";"I got a snake that was a plain, dull dark green color on top and unpainted on bottom. No where near as nicely painted as the one pictured. Looked like a dollar store item."
"OR";"VERY well made, easy for an ol' mechanic to install, requires an outdoor 2X4 I had to provide, but a really well made product to fix the gate that always stuck..."
"OR";"This didn't seem to work for what I needed it to clean. I am trying to get out set on hard water stains and yellowing from marble. This product didn't seem to help. I think I'm going to have to call a professional."
"OR";"This pot is amazing. Looks so beautiful and performs great so far. It is pretty heavy and love the fact that has the glass lid. I'll update in case something changes."
"OR";"Finally........a bottle brush with bristles on the bottom.  You might have to twist and turn it a little to get into a small-necked item but it doesn't take much.  I hope it lasts forever but I know which one to buy again if I need it!"
"OR";"I love the frame, except I got the wrong size and it was too big and bulky to return for an exchange. Because of that I have been living with the wrong size frame for over a year. Saving up to get the right size frame!"
"OR";"my grandson loves this.............  he plays with it often. gave it to him at 12 months, still playing with it at 18 months. nice little farm animal set, highly recommend it"
"OR";"My friend hasn't worn this one yet, so I can't give it an honest review, but he loved the white one. I will assumed he loves this one as well!"
"OR";"My family eats very healthy, clean foods with no sugar and high protein. We have multiple dietary needs and because of this making meals can be a challenge. A healthy lifestyle is a healthy you. That is one of the important things that makes us happy. Eating the right and nutritious foods are essent"
"OR";"This book started out slow in the beginning but steadily picked up the pace and by the end was an intense.  It hits you with the shot you aren't expecting and makes you wish it was a bit longer....Cant wait for to read more of his books.  Good for fans of  what would you do if it happend to you."
"OR";"Runs about a half size large. Nice soft suede. I got the Grey color and it is quite a bit lighter than the product photo-it's more of a silver in real life. The insoles should be padded for more comfort."
"OR";"Good mystery woven with Cornish folklore and families. Good character development and an interesting and different story. Lots of intrigue and a blossoming romance with the promise of a HEA ending eventually."
"OR";"This book is so funny you will literally have tears of laughter running down your face. It is hilarious because it's all true. You definitely have to be a mom though to get the humor. Baby Sideburns rules. A must read if you are a fan!"
"OR";"This puts out very little oil. It's hard to tell if it's even working. The reason I can tell is that it sounds like it is boiling when it is on. There is definitely a boiling water sound, so I don't know that the ""whisper"" name applies."
"OR";"This is a high quality clip but I have not used it much with my Leatherman Wave since it is a bit heavy to clip to your pocket. However, given the price, it is nice to have a clip handy should I need it."
"OR";"One of the best books ever written. Kline managed to incorporate so many pop culture references from the 1980s into this book that I was stunned. It's also a perfect photograph of the internet in the late 1990s."
"OR";"Product works Great!!!  I seriously came home seeing a box and I was like, what the hell is this?  Then after opening i couldn't believe this part was already at my door!!  It was seriously there like 12 hours after i ordered it.  Wicked Fast..."
"OR";"I really enjoyed watching this movie.  I missed it in the theaters and wanted to see it before the Oscars were presented.  Great acting, especially by Bruce Dern, and I loved the black and white."
"OR";"I bought this lcd last Christmas to be used in my bedroom. I have no complaints. The picture and sound are fine for late night viewing. The sleep timer is very convenient. I consider this a great value..."
"OR";"Some rope toys are too thin for large dogs.  This one is a thicker rope toy and offers hours a tug related fun for one of my dogs.  These work well to floss dogs teeth if they like to chew on them."
"OR";"This book handles difficult parts of life in a fun, entertaining, and thought provoking way. It is hard to put down and enjoyable to read. The characters are real and relatable."
"OR";"worked great for my dress to give me sleeves without dying of heat.  Originally bought a large but was swimming in it.  Medium fit though.  I am 5'6 150 and a DD"
"OR";"I have a big melon and this hat fits well but the adjustment strap in the back is short enough that it comes undone from the back of the hat. Small melon? Probably no worries."
"OR";"Works well, however the auto-switch sometimes will screw up. If Game console wakes up from sleep for updates, it will autoswitch when not wanted.  Not a big deal for me, but should be noted for others who might end up in similar situation."
"OR";"Excellent film and a great story telling of a truly historic event. Sure it looks a little dated in some ways now, and his dog's name would cause consternation these days, but every bit as enjoyable as  when I watched it as a kid."
"OR";"I bought this to float out in the lake, keeps my shoulders even with the water i weigh 170lbs.  Works good for floating in water drinking your favor drink and gives you the comfort if your a bad swimmer like me."
"OR";"My 3 year old daughter is a big ""Jake and the Neverland Pirates"" fan. This is a fun game for her to play. I like it because it is easy to pull out of the closet and play with. Very simple to play."
"OR";"This book contains an exhaustive list of aphrodisiacs. Some are the common ones that everyone has heard of, but there are a number which I was completely unfamiliar with. It even includes several recipes at the end, which is a really nice touch."
"OR";"The pajamas arrived in a beautiful box and enclosed in paper.  It was like opening a surprise instead of pajamas.  The pajamas are of good quality and has washed well.  Will order more."
"OR";"The subject matter ok, but I wish I'd known it was about some 17-18 year olds. I couldn't finish the book due to not being able to relate to the characters. The storyline was believable for the age group just not what I expected."
"OR";"I chose this on a recommendation from a reliable friend. In the beginning I had hope this book would become more likable.  I trudged through to the end.  I could not identify with any of the characters.  I was not sympathetic to any of the main characters.  Don't waste your time."
"OR";"Good quality and print is nice.  On the thin side as far as throws go, but it's just what we wanted...a thinner layer for summer.  Plus, perfect for Star Wars fans!"
"OR";"I know pretty is a weird word to use for men's pajama pants but... the coloring really is just that. Such a nice color scheme and the colors pop and are really vibrant. I bought it as a gift for my brother and he loves them, and they also fit him perfectly."
"OR";"The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does work on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT."
"OR";"this hub was exactly what I needed to hook up additional usb devices and the size of it made it more desirable. I'm happy with the device and the transaction as well. Thank you from one satisfied customer."
"OR";"Very cute, heel a bit thin for frequent use but pretty and smart looking with dresses and pants. No extra jewelry meeded. Would have given it 5 stars for a thicker heel."
"OR";"This is the perfect fan. My husband hates fans and I am dyeing of heat during the night. I put it right beside me, he can't hear a peep and the air goes directly on me! Awesome buy!"
"OR";"Great way to recycle old throw pillows, the dog theme is cool and colorful, the price was great for a linen cover, I would recommend"
"OR";"Be aware of size.  If you have it correct, these work great.  The chairs slide easily on a wood floor.  The product appears to be substantially built and should hold up a long time."
"OR";"This was purchased for my 4 year old grandson who is getting interested in board games and we are trying to have him play more with games that you are inter active with friends and family.  He is quite competitive so this was perfect."
"OR";"Bought this to hold up small motion sensor light. Works like a charm, very satisfied.  Also, thanks to other Amazon commenter for recommending this product when they were reviewing the motion sensor light."
"OR";"Does exactly what it's supposed to do and gives you a positive purchase on the handgun grip. Doesn't quite fit as well as TALON grips, and they stick off the frame slightly. But overall good product and great grip accessory."
"OR";"What would you do if you were in love with your boss?
Lisa is a nymph in love with,her boss, what should she do?
I love how this unfolds and I have to say the first quarter in the series has been wonderful.
Looking for to May."
"OR";"im glad i bought this toy. it does alot when learning #'s, abc's, shapes. this toy is very helpful. dont leave it on without use because u'll run the batteries down. but very useful and fun!!!! not 2 complicated."
"OR";"Great protection from cuts and abrasions, well made and put together. Good grip and ridges on fingers provide better than expected grip and hand protection."
"OR";"Well, the dogs seem to like them, although once they start chewing on them, there are sharp edges that have cut my pup's mouth.  The odor is awful, but maybe the dogs like that.  The price is too high for the amount of time that they last."
"OR";"I bought it and use it but I don't see much birds like it much  some time three or four days still outside ,, no idea why ,, but its conv delivered home  & I may be change other next time ,,"
"OR";"This was a great love story. I think m/m books are so much more than if it was m/f. I think u can fell the love in these books. It was an awesome story."
"OR";"Awesome tool roll up. It is made for various types of tools. It is easy to put tools there and easily to see what tools are available. Good to have in your car or office. I recommend buying this."
"OR";"Enjoyed this book very interesting and also very sad good the way it moved from the forties to the nineties felt you knew the 4 women lovely book"
"OR";"I have three of these in my home and plan to buy at least one more. With two dogs it is nice to be able to remove and wash. And they are tough and my dogs love them. Plus they are very stylish!"
"OR";"Cute, quirky, ""this would never happen in real life"" romantic short story. this is a good quick read for anyone who still believes in fairy tale endings."
"OR";"I have two rabbits who are not jumpers. This suits them perfectly! The divider is great providing a nap/potty area from the play area. Even my kitten loves to be in it! Super easy to put together and clean! I will be buying another!"
"OR";"Macaulay is the master of simplifying complex topics.  He's easy to follow, extremely well illustrated, and gripping -- which is a lot to be said for an historic architecture series! If you like to know how things work, buy any of his books."
"OR";"Flimsy construction, and warped. I bought 3 and they are all this way. However, in my cabinets with moderate weight, they are functional. Would not buy again but considering these were the cheapest available for this size, I got what I paid for."
"OR";"A realistic view of the life led by the SF teams both in country, and on base & R& R. The characters become real, and the emotions ring true.  One of the best novelsI have read!"
"OR";"I've had the 5 months now, and it's still like brand new.  It has a really nice durable cord; there is no wear on it.  The locking mechanism is easy and is also still 100%."
"OR";"This is really the absolute best piece of glass in the price range. People comparing it to scopes that cost two or three times as much are missing the picture. You just aren't going to find a Mil/Mil FFP scope with usable glass at this price from anyone else.

The picture is bright, clear, and disto"
"OR";"Just finished rereading it for the third time, since the new one's come out. Thought I'd update my original review. Any book worth multiple rereads is worth a five star review."
"OR";"Impressed!! Ordered from Amazon Prime, showed up right on time and packaged well.... I'm a plumber by trade, I don't deal much with this sort of thing however I know quality when I see it. This unit is built well, very easy to assemble and set up. My existing confidante drain was routed through my c"
"OR";"For the price I'm very pleased with these rings. They look good and are very comfortable. I feel like they could be a little more durable but for the price I would recommend these to anyone."
"OR";"I love how these fit. My head is on the smaller side; I can see how people think these run small but they are perfect for me. Really attractive looking and they don't fog when I run in them!"
"OR";"My oldest son absolutely loves this! It goes a lot faster than I expected but he doesn't mind! Us adults even have a blast on it! Definitely a good buy!"
"OR";"It's a great little enclosure for the price. It works at USB 3.0 speed as specified. I got my 2.5"" SATA 2 drive running at almost 100MB/s R/W via ATTO."
"OR";"I didn't know these were 108s when I bought them, so thats my fault, but even so the closure isn't that great and the wraps are just a bit more stiff than I'd like, they don't stay on my hands as well as I'd like either."
"OR";"I'm changing my review from 2 to 4 because in retrospect I like it a lot but you will have to add weight to keep it from sliding around.
The reason I like it is because it's low profile and accessible from all sides."
"OR";"I got the wrench to use for adjusting my band saw. The original band saw wrenches were cheap and far too short. This makes saw adjustments much easier and I like that."
"OR";"It is cheap and works.  What else is there to know about this?  I have a small microwave and it fits, but barely.  So you might want to check the size of your microwave compared to this cover before buying if you have a small one."
"OR";"I thought this story was pretty boring but a quick read and free.  I didn't see what the purpose of having a grandfather telling the kids this story which really had nothing to do with Christmas in my opinion."
"OR";"These are super cute, very comfortable and warm. I don't like to wear them barefoot as I can feel the seams, but with a pair of socks they are just right. Fun slippers, well crafted. I've gotten compliments from friends and family."
"OR";"This dress is very cute but made a bit smaller than other Fitwarm brand size mediums. Also material is too soft which allows the sides to bunch together and hang on the floor."
"OR";"This was a fun quick read. Brand and Viv's relationship grew over many years. Since it was quick, not a lot of character development but I still enjoyed the short story."
"OR";"I love it.  This one has an extra step, three instead of two with my other one.  All parts fit securely, so it's not easy to figure out if you don't know the procedure."
"OR";"Definitely a good read. # teammoniandomega
I definitely didn't see that ending coming with jazz. I'm glad that tahani finally came to her senses but it was rather late."
"OR";"A great product for those of us who have chickens and don't want to keep using old egg cartons.  Super sturdy so it won't break any time soon and fits 18 eggs, more if you stack them when you're over run ;)"
"OR";"They just get the job done. I am an amateur video enthusiast. And, they are just the right one's for me for such a reasonable price. I can't say if it works for professionals. I just have a feeling it wont, professionals look else-where."
"OR";"The on off button is sometimes hard to hit, perhaps if it was raised a bit would help. I like the diffused light and goose neck which gives you the ability to arrange it on a desktop for convenient light."
"OR";"I am 36 years old, and I have four kids. Last year I decided it was time to lost the extra pounds that didn't come off after my 4th pregnancy, so after browsing amazon for some ideas I stumbled upon Jillian's 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones. These videos work. If you are using proper form, wo"
"OR";"This is an absolutely awesome little light. Nice and bright. I've been carrying it everyday now for about 3 months, dropped it several dozen times, still works like a charm. Going through a battery about once a month, not bad..."
"OR";"Since the first book of this series was written, I have kept up with each new novel. I love the stories about Angel Island... after falling in love with the people of Cape Light! Great books. Easy reads. Thought-provoking. Looking forward to the next book!"
"OR";"a bit technical to set up and I am a techy person, but they do the job and work great for the room heaters I have around the house. Saving money since we were running them too long when we weren't home or in the rooms. Now I don't have to worry about them."
"OR";"I got this for my husband who loves to make one egg in the morning without using a huge pan.  This pan has tall sides, which are useful when you (I) overfill it.  Handy little pan."
"OR";"I don't usually give up on a book because I think ""it will get better.  This book I finally gave up on and decided there was no hope. Starts out slow and stays that way"
"OR";"Wife likes them.  I was a little concerned after the first round through the dishwasher as one of the bowls developed a wobble instead of sitting flat on the counter.  It turned out the I needed to ""pop-it"" back out and is like new again."
"OR";"I like the color on bottom for keeping track of your own glass.  The have a little waviness to the sides - I wasn't expecting that, but it doesn't really bother me.  They are a little fragile and they have a dip in the bottom that holds dishwasher water."
"OR";"This movie is a tear jerker. It is about two young people who find each other and fall in love. They fall into forbidden love. It has a sad ending so if you are a happy ending person, perhaps this isn't for you. The acting is pretty good, but not the best."
"OR";"For me, this movie captures all the magic and imagination of Walt Disney in a way few others ever have. I own this DVD myself and bought it for my daughter and my grandchildren. This movie is a true classic that I think never has received the acclaim it is due."
"OR";"I bought this because my daughter had one and my husband liked it.
He uses it all the time great little item for one or two cups. No fuss really."
"OR";"I liked the idea of this toy but once I received it I left it in the packaging and re-gifted it to someone else.  It seemed way to complicated for a baby and overall isn't something I would have bought had I seen it in the store."
"OR";"I wasn't expecting it to be a collection of stories.
Not after having seen the movie!

Asimov does such a great job in explaining the psyche of ""the robot""..
Starting with the most simple and ending with the grand scheme!

Loved the book!! Strongly recommended for SciFi lovers..."
"OR";"I love Isle of Dogs Shampoo's. This one smells awesome and my boy came out looking clean, with soft hair after the bath. Highly recommend."
"OR";"I am happy with this purchase. It is longer than I need for my cage so I cut it in half and saved one half for later. My bunny seems to like it and has now begun to chew on it. Overall I would purchase again"
"OR";"Great product.  The quality of the fabric and the construction are good.  They fit well, and they are as advertised.  I've had good luck with Docker's products, and this one is no exception."
"OR";"Worked great and kept the cat busy for hours.  Like that it only lasts for 15 minutes or so so it doesn't wear the cat out but you can keep re-setting it to keep them entertained."
"OR";"Amazingly sharp and great quality, as I've come to expect from all Cold Steel knives!  Was planning to use in a canoe survival kit but may need to order another because this has become my new favorite!"
"OR";"I bought two of these for our home and love them.  They work extremely well with our Home Security system which allows us to control them through the same APP.  It makes it nice to have a smart home and control the temperature from anywhere."
"OR";"For those like myself who wondered how a bunch of English kids had such a huge impact on pop music in the 60s and beyond, this book explains a lot - a first hand account from one of the most important figures of the British Invasion.  Keith talks about the Stones early influences and how they progre"
"OR";"I've had several pair of these sandals and really like them.  However, the tightness of the straps varies with each pair.  This pair just happens to have looser straps than the last.  Still find them comfortable."
"OR";"Its really a top quality watch winder. Its more than what I had expected. Good build, and so far so good. Although I started using it in less than one month but it work well. No noise and work well.

Hopefully it continue to work well."
"OR";"This is not the ""bendable"" soft bone like the other one this company sells. My dog goes nuts for the bendable one thats minty. This one, she won't touch."
"OR";"Love this book!  The ""Potty"" story is good, but DD loves all of the flaps.  I love that this can be a very interactive book and she loves to tell me what the pictures are under the flaps."
"OR";"Seam popped within second use.  Since then the seam has popped in several other places.  We still use it, but I don't know how much longer it will stay in one piece."
"OR";"Colleen Houck is an incredible author! Reawakened was an incredibly interesting book. Houck's knowledge of ancient cultures helps further the experience. I cannot wait for the release of the next book in the series."
"OR";"What a neat thing! I can fit several bills in it and it looks and feels like a real bolt. I'm a retired mechanic and thought there's no way this could ever fool me."
"OR";"I've searched all over for a bra that is small enough around and big enough in the bust and this one is perfect! I've had to cut out wires before because they were bruising my ribs, so this bra was everything I was looking for!"
"OR";"It works nicely. To customize it is a pain. Double press this button, hold that one for 16 seconds, yadda yadda...with with some time and patience you'll get it to where you want as far as sound."
"OR";"Operation takes some practice, since there is just the one button, but after that, it works great. Especially like that it is extra reliable, as I can use 2 different types of batteries."
"OR";"These pj's are wonderful. The fit is great and the fabric makes you feel glorious the second you put them on.
I bought the pink and immediately ordered and already received the plaid.
The shorts are longer than typical pj shorts which is nice."
"OR";"All I have to say is that this is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. I won't rehash the plot. I just remember thinking multiple times while I read it how beautifully written it is."
"OR";"My 4 year old Granddaughter really loved making me a necklace with this wooden bead set, as it is well made and easy to thread the beads onto the string."
"OR";"I installed these on my bike and they work good.  About 35 and I need gloves.  About 10 and my hands will start to hurt, so I have electric grip heaters.  So, they work good for keeping off wind and water, but aren't too insulating."
"OR";"This table is perfect at the beach. Keeps sand from getting on your phone, food or whatever else you put on it. It folds nicely into a canvas bag and stores nicely too. I recommend this product."
"OR";"I have used Wellness Core products for over 10 years.  My rotties have lived fairly long and healthy lives.  My last girl lived to be 14 years old."
"OR";"Best carpet cleaner out there! We have two dogs and in our spot and big steam cleaner it takes care of anything that comes out of them. Love the smell too! Its lighly minty and didn't linger for days like others."
"OR";"The entire story was very predicateble, this is what I liked the least. What I liked the best is her imagination. I also found that the entire story should have been in one book, not in 3. I suppose it was a matter of cost for the Author who, obviously,  earned more that way. I did not like this at "
"OR";"This is a great time piece, however for me the big downside is;
 In low lighted situation the hands will disappear and or are cammaflogde by the details on the face of the watch ma king it impossible for me to read. Not for low light"
"OR";"My dogs love these chews, but they are gone within five minutes. There are many other chews that offer more bang for the buck. Though I may revisit these in the future since my girls do love 'em."
"OR";"Perfect size for my growing pacman frog. He's only a few months old but he loves his new pool. Will likely fit fine as an adult, but we'll see"
"OR";"Really huge barely fits my tank, but I liked it so well I made it work. The plant is well made. The color is phenomenal.  I have a 10 gal. tank."
"OR";"I own a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marines-Airsoft-SR01-Spring-Powered-Rifle-by-Crosman/dp/B005HGAZUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marines Airsoft SR01 Spring Powered Rifle by Crosman</a>, and have owned a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a"
"OR";"It is way to small, possibly perfect for maybe a small person? I am confused because an XL is suppose to mean Extra Large not Small...
One star for soft material and because zero wasn't optional."
"OR";"I guess it comes down to I love a great epic type story and this delivers ... although you do have to overlook HBO's preoccupation with the human body in an unclothed state. ... I gues they think less is more , so unorginal HBO."
"OR";"Very good. I thought it was a real moss ball for my bush nose to play with. Anyway, it seems a good one cleaning water from reading all the previous reviews."
"OR";"I ordered this product and was charged for it, but never received it. Apparently it wasn't in stock after all. I'm a little sad that I don't own it, but the seller promptly made good on their mistake and fully refunded the order."
"OR";"This is a terrible product. It doesn't sit up on its own. I'm so mad at myself for even buying this but all the previous reviews made it look so great. Total waste of money. My 10 lb min pin can barely hide out in it!!"
"OR";"Pleasers are always the best, they fit perfect. I do reccomend if you are a size 8 1/2 to go with a size 8 in pleasers, their shoes do run a little big."
"OR";"Love Wellness, but my kitties are not real fond on the larger cut in this variety..I use the pate all the time..will try selects for the next round.  Nothing bur Wellness..ever."
"OR";"I tried 2 from each container (4 total)

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks lik"
"OR";"All of the excitement and also the conflicts of this story were erased by a terrible ending with too many loose threads hanging. Why ruin the story with no hope and the only way to pick it back up again would be ""cheesy""."
"OR";"I bought this antenna in hopes of receiving more OTA TV. But ended up only getting about 2 channels that didn't seem to work half the time. I switched to the Winegard Metrostar 2000, and have had a lot better success."
"OR";"This is nothing special, but it does what it is supposed to do. I've used it in one race and it held my timing tag in place nicely. I wanted something that allows me to change my shoes or wear none, depending on how I feel."
"OR";"Nice set of bulbs, they aren't too bright but bring a nice ambient light. They are very attractive, interesting. People always ask about them. I have them throughout my kitchen, again if you haven't purchased these before they are dim."
"OR";"I adore Jet and Ayden separately but together they are AMAZING!!! Jay Crownover has done it again!! Loved this book as much as I adore Rule!! Can't wait for Rome's story!!"
"OR";"Some separate stories, but with common elements. I think that I like the other series by Stross more, but maybe I'm just not of the target audience. I still plan to read the other parts of the AA series."
"OR";"Very handy caulk tube sealers.
Very simple concept, not much to them but they work.
After a while the caulk starts to dry in the sealer cap, but
you can still pull it out and reuse it.
Worth getting and trying"
"OR";"Pretty much works as advertised and less expensive Han the Nest thermostat. For the most part, customer support is responsive since here are some occasional hiccups. I've had this for several months. Unfortunately, I noticed an alert on the thermostat staying that it was waiting for an update. This "
"OR";"I bought this cubic rube for my husband, that's his new hobby. And he said it works really smooth. Exactly how he wanted. Doesn't brake, its have duty. He is happy with this product."
"OR";"Size is adjustable so it will fit just about anybody. Definitely a nicely made hat, and I really like the digital camo pattern which is a little dark. Nothing like ACU, and slightly different than the woodland MARPAT."
"OR";"Appear to be of good quality.  They are going to be exposed to winter weather so we will see how well they hold up after winter in the northeast.  For now Ill givr it 5 stars but will update if they don't hold up."
"OR";"Love these fun sporty socks. I use them to play softball and constantly get compliments. I would definitely recommend them and continue to buy them in other colors."
"OR";"Both of my cockers wear these and they are fantastic for night use.  Highly recommended if you do not have a fenced yard or are prone to taking your dogs outside off leash either after dark or even in the early twilight hours."
"OR";"The best part of this scene is the cannon that swivels on the turret and the Tauntaun.  Let's face it-Tauntauns do not grow on trees in the Lego world and are exclusive to this set.  The fact that it also comes with two Snowtroopers, the Han Solo and two Rebels means 5 minifigs and said Tauntan for "
"OR";"This Hand Warmer is okay for the price.  It is kinda flimsy though.  It doesnt hold shape like a cylinder like the ones the Pros wear but it does the job."
"OR";"Great product and a great price. Shipped fast and answered my questions in a timely manner. Ended up being made a lot sturdier than I expected. Should last a lifetime."
"OR";"This was largely a retelling of the story. There is no development of the characters. It is very simplistic in the story and the vocabulary. I did finish it, but I could only skim the last half. Not worth my time or money, and I got for free!"
"OR";"This shorty serves the purpose. You can make shoots in tight areas as that's what it was designed for. One piece and made ok. It has a 12MM leather tip. Nothing to rave about but it works as intended."
"OR";"A really, really good romance, and some mystery added in. I must admit that I figured out who did it before it was revealed. However, I always enjoy Nora Roberts' books. I look forward to them."
"OR";"This was a well made case, good quality for a very reasonable price. It was a gift to hold a portable car dvd player (also a gift) and there is plenty of room for the whole system and plenty also for extras. Very happy with it."
"OR";"Review do-over.  Continued to ask for disc every time. It's obvious  that this product should be sold with a disc. Not solo. Never worked again question if the adaptor had any thing to do with it working the first time"
"OR";"Best car camping sleeping bag ever. especially on those colder camping nights. Not as hard as some are saying about stuffing it back into the bag. Just shove it in starting at one end and rotate as you go."
"OR";"Loved the camera! Very easy to navigate and easy to learn!
The whole package was great! Only problem was the camera stand, it broke as soon as I took it out. But other than that, I love the quality of this camera.
Attached are pictures that I took using the camera!"
"OR";"I didn't realize the pieces would be so chunky. I guess the product is fine for reptiles, and just not for crabs. I used it towards the bottom of my tank and mixed it with sand. It does hold moisture very well."
"OR";"I enjoyed reading this book.  it was very well written and kept my interest.  It was interesting how you hurd the other side of the story.  I would like to read the entire series."
"OR";"I bought 3 pairs and they are awesome! Great quality and I would buy again, makes a great gift comes with a nice box for giving."
"OR";"The carabiner is kind of a pain to use.  I like it because it fits well in a pocket when I am not using it.  To be honest it is not much better than a cheap leash that costs 5 bucks."
"OR";"These items are great, but did not seem to last long. Are little dashund puppy ( Lacey) went to tearing all the plastic parts out of these toys. But she loved them. Would recommend to everyone i know. Lacey hates the squeaking sound."
"OR";"This is a beautiful story about the true meaning of Christmas.  The story is told with a healthy does of humor, and my whole family enjoys it.
This series is the best, and I definitely recommend this Chrismas DVD."
"OR";"My dog gets terrible hot spots. My Vet recommended the Douxo line of antiseptic products. They work fantastically! Healing starts on day one."
"OR";"This is a good product. Durable. I wasn't able to find a suitable snack for it yet to have it fit perfectly, but my dog still likes to chase it and chew on it, and so far this is the only toy that wasn't destroyed in 1 day."
"OR";"FINALLY! I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for The Alpha King, but I know I've worked my way through a few versions of the Kindle since I first read The First Alpha!

I fell deeply in love with this series way back in 2013, and since then I've checked back every week for news on the sequel"
"OR";"My first impression of the first several pages, was to skip to another book. And I did. But, I came back to finish this well written and very moving book. Not often can someone express their feelings in such a way that you can know and ""feel"" along with them."
"OR";"Bought for my cat for christmas pictures. Hes pretty fat so i bought the large and the buttons wouldnt close at all, but nonetheless it still looked very cute. Barely could notice the not closed buttons"
"OR";"I've been using these cookie sheets for years. My originals are in great shape but I ordered a couple more for our vacation home. They arrived with a few dents but I don't think this will affect the function of the pans."
"OR";"I'm a chesty 220lb woman and XL fits perfect!! I was so worried that it might not fit me but luckily it's perfect. The stitching is incredible, it looks just like the picture and it makes me so happy to have. So worth the money and was well packaged."
"OR";"Sean and Kay are awesome together!  I love how the story steered me in a direction I didn't even conclude until the last scene.  I am so glad about how Sean turns out.  I can't wait to read more about him and Kay together."
"OR";"It reads different and helps in some of our Bible studies. It helps some different members understand the lesson different than the King James Bible.  It also easy to find the book and chapters you want to read."
"OR";"Works as expected.  It is a cheap model so I don't expect it to hold up to heavy duty use.  For small, at home projects, it seems perfectly sufficient.  I absolutely prefer models with variable speed."
"OR";"The book was good. It introduced many more characters and also had a very good plot and minor plots. You should read this book if you liked the first ones."
"OR";"Can't beat it for the price. Has everything needed to get started. Ordered 6 kits for my children and all performed flawlessly. Even better than some of the other higher dollar guns being used at our first outing."
"OR";"Stpehen King's Under the Dome had me unable to turn off my kindle! This story and characters had me glued to them. A page turner in its truest sense! Even if you don't consider yourself a Stephen King fan you should read this book."
"OR";"Product is smaller than expected.  This item was purchased twice (one for me and one for another).  Both had to be exchanged and seller requires purchaser to pay for return shipping on exchanges which cost over $10."
"OR";"These are quite cheap in terms of quality.  You get what you pay for, I know, but even for $6 it could at least look like it wasn't going to leak ASAP."
"OR";"Dang.. Emily Blunt and Tom Cruises chemistry .

Wish I can meet someone like her over and over again. Really love this movie. Idea is fun especially if you're a gamer"
"OR";"i bought these partially for the fact that they're nonstick.  well, after the 3rd time using the middle one, one area in no longer nonstick. so now i need to grease and flour. so , back to the basics.  otherswise, nice pans."
"OR";"Thisi s a great product, I've tried it on several of my rifles and it fit like a glove. It is sure going to make shooting my Mosin Nagants alot easier. Fast shipping and good price also."
"OR";"I like themI like them a lot and tend to just buy this brand as I get what I expected. Very comfortable even after they have been washed many times. Do shrink a bit, but I am tracking with that.  a lot and tend to just buy this brand as I get what I expected."
"OR";"I am an avid gym goer and i have been looking for a resource to help me improve with kettlebells and this book was the answer. I am highly impressed with the workouts in this book and i cant wait to give them a try,"
"OR";"Got a blue and pink one in the pack - have used in the swimming pool and seems to be made of a thicker material so has yet to spring any leaks.
I would buy this again"
"OR";"my dogs love these treats and they are easy to break apart for sharing.  Wish the
strips were bigger.  Don't leave the lid off or they will dry up and become very hard to chew."
"OR";"The author has a way with words and weaving a story and making you fall in love with her characters and making you feel invested in their story and what happens next for them.  I look forward to more...."
"OR";"We love the Professional Grooming Dog Nail Clippers it's truly awesome the handles are soft and molds to fit your hand.  The products exceeded our expectations we are completely satisfied with this transaction.and would buy from this seller again."
"OR";"AWESOME PRODUCT! DESERVES WAY MORE THAN 5 STARS! I HAVE BEEN USING THIS ATSKO SILICONE WATER GUARD SPRAY FOR MANY YEARS ON ALL MY SHOES/SNEAKERS/BOOTS/CLOTHING ETC ETC AND THIS SPRAY HANDS DOWN IS THE GREATEST!!!! A++++++"
"OR";"I love the book oh my gosh it is amazing a true test of love heartache all so bittersweet. The most amazing read in an truly excited to read the sequel. Jasmine the no nonsense woman and chase the enigmatic playboy both excellent characters"
"OR";"Arrived fast and fits great. Thick tablecloth and washes well, i even throw in dryer and no need to iron. A cup of water was spilled on top of tablecloth and it did it soak through to my wood table!"
"OR";"Unbelievably cute. Saw the guitar player in Mexico and had to find one. Bonus, got the whole band! Pictures don't do it justice, wish I could post a video!"
"OR";"fits well and is cool enough for weather up to about 80 then its a little heavy and I have to switch to the net type fly sheet. I was hoping to use it all summer for preventing coat bleaching. nice construction."
"OR";"My dog likes it and she's elderly.  I don't know that it actually makes a difference in her joints, she is a 3 legged friend and I'm trying to prevent any further discomfort or issues."
"OR";"This collapsible sink folds down very compact, the handles feel sturdy, I have washed it by hand and it's easy to clean with soap and water. it's a very good size to hold a lot of dishes."
"OR";"It was a second set I'd bought.  like the overall look as much as the functionality.  I put it in my kitchen around my dining table to keep my pooch from having accident on the rug. A little pricey but worth the cost."
"OR";"Seemed like a good value, but a couple of the packages had either old or defective batteries in them. Not sure I would order this brand again. In a home where there are three hearing aides, it's important to know the batteries on hand work."
"OR";"I have 2 boxers that I felt needed a little warming at night, even though they sleep in the house.  The fit is true to size and the length is appropriately long.  Washes well and my dogs don't mind them."
"OR";"I bought this to trick out yorkie and yorkie-poo into better smiles.  While the spray smells nice and minty - the size of the ball is too big for my 5 and 12 pound dogs.  So for me, it's okay."
"OR";"Like my new watch, looking for a Watch with Roman numerals, the strap is very soft. The only thing The hands don't glow in the dark, but for the price would recommend."
"OR";"I actually had one dose without any medication in it. I m sure it was a manufacturing snafu but none the less.... Also, it works but doesn t seem to last for 30 days...more like 2.5 to 3 weeks."
"OR";"For the money its an excellent value. Its for light duty home use. As long as your not trying to grind 1 inch rebar to a point , you should be OK. I use it for sharpening drill bits and chisels."
"OR";"This shoe is a great addition to the burst of colors that I have in mind this coming summer. It is very sexy and kind of comfortable. It is high so if you are not a sky high stilletto diva, then these are not your speed. But they are an awesome must have. So glad that I purchased them."
"OR";"I did an install job with this in a 96 Land Rover Discovery. The cables made the length of the whole vehicle, they stripped easy, and made some pretty sharp corners. I will be using these again in future installs!"
"OR";"My 2 year old son plays with these small dinosaur figurines more than any of his other more exciting and larger toys.  This is a good buy for the money.  I would purchase again."
"OR";"This was a old good animation from pixars studios. Watching this movie brings back when i had it for VHS. but now blu ray. i love this movie and i would recommend this to kids"
"OR";"Very cool Magnus. I love how minimus sits in his chest. Very cool. Great sculpt. The guns are kind of dumb. But I made my own on shapeways. If you are looking for one, search for mine on shapeways under forge of hausjam prime."
"OR";"It took me only fifteen minutes to get used to the toe/heel rock, and after I got used to it, I really liked it. It must really be good for the ankle joints--keeps them lubricated."
"OR";"I installed the newest firmware, and DVDs still appear very pixellated. I can watch the same DVDs on my X-Box and they are MUCH clearer. I have both players connected by component cables, but I tried with basic RCA video on a non-HDTV and the pixellation was still horribly apparent. It does play a l"
"OR";"It took me 2 attempts (months apart) to make it through this book.

I don't enjoy adventure stories all that much. I need my brain to be stimulated by conniving plot twists or revealing secrets or a romance. Adventure stories don't provide that for me. They move at a slower pace that just builds and"
"OR";"Worked great on our first campout - there was light rain, and the bottom of our tent stayed dry.  Seems durable, the campsite had rocks everywhere and the groundsheet didn't rip or tear."
"OR";"Antonio Antonio Antonio he was so yummy and in super alpha mode, I just love him, I recommend this book to every one how love alpha male and hot sex scene."
"OR";"Wonderboys is an artsy film. It is about as far from the mainstream as you can get. Homosexuality, dead dog in the trunk, marijuana/alcohol abuse: such subject matter makes WB decidedly NOT a family or date movie. Not one you would watch with your mom. Wonderboys is best watched with open-minded fri"
"OR";"What a extreme disappointment this kayak is.  I ended getting a hole right in the seam of the haul right underneath where I was sitting. This occurred after my third time taking it out. I was a couple miles down river from my car and was left stranded with a sinking boat beyond repair. The repair ki"
"OR";"Finally a cone our dog could eat with, sleep on, and not damage the entire house running into things in!
Did give him a light snore when it was too inflated, but hey, that's just our dog."
"OR";"My cats really didn't go for this. So it sits in the room unused. Great idea I would guess for younger cats but my older cats don't want to bother with it."
"OR";"Easy to install and the quality of the fixture feels superb. Well made fixture with sleek and elegant design. All the hardware needed to install cane with it, and the instructions were clearly written."
"OR";"This was another awesome installment in the series.  I loved the relationship/ connection between the black dragon and Kara.  I loved that this boll focused on having an emotional connection instead of a physical one.  Can't wait to read the next one!"
"OR";"I am very happy with these churidars. They not only look nice, but can accommodate my body which is not small. I bought others in a large size and they were incredibly small and a waste of money and time. These particular churidars should accommodate various body sizes."
"OR";"Was a gift, not extrememly happy with product. It had alot of paint issues, glue issues and I had to attempt to correct the problem myself. Ive bought other POP Funko toys and not had this issue before. Not very happy w this purchase"
"OR";"Hard to clean metal shavings out of bit. magnet is really strong but shavings prevent screws from  sitting true so you spend a lot of time cleaning the bit, pretty much after ever screw"
"OR";"Don't even think twice, just read this book. It is very hot, naughty, funny, heart-warming.  I couldn't recommend it any higher, pure 5 stars most definitely."
"OR";"This cross is simple but elegant and just the right size for me!  Very well made and will last a long time plus you can use it on different length chains since the bale is not teeny tiny and will accommodate other chains easily."
"OR";"It's made of a terrible fabric. Dress Shirt?, forget about it.  The image uploaded by the seller it's very very tricky.
It looks great in the photograph, but it doesn't once you have the shirt on your hands at front of you.
Don't buy it."
"OR";"New puppy really likes this bed, so easy to take care of. Puppy had one accident due to my not paying attention, but throw it in the wash and good as new."
"OR";"Great little speaker!  Connects right to USB port, not bulky!  Nice to have while just lounging in bed or on couch and need a little more sound!  Excellent sound quality!!"
"OR";"This is a really sweet and funny read. The first section, about a holiday tradition,  feels like a relaxing and hilarious conversation with a good friend. It's the perfect little story to get you smiling and considering the magic of Christmas."
"OR";"From the photo I expected this to be taller. It says 11"" high but I measured it and its not that tall. The color is good and quality seems good, but for this small size it is way overpriced."
"OR";"Bought this for my son who is third grade. He uses it with supervision and is able to navigate on his own for his homework and research. It's versatile and he can do any work that he needs. Paired with the key board, he is pleased. Performance is good enough for him."
"OR";"I would never order these again. If I could take a photo and show you how yellow these are I would. I hate to see what is coming into my healthy cats water right now. Go to the other buyer I bought them from, look at my history, his were perfect. He has my business from now on."
"OR";"Recipient loved it, a lot. However, what's not so lovable, is the mess. It's also too expensive, in my opinion. As long as you don't mind the price or the inevitable mess of water and glitter everywhere, go for it."
"OR";"This is the fastest charger I've ever used. It literally charges from low battery to 100% in less than an hour. But it does need an outlet plug. It's much slower when a USB port is used"
"OR";"Great camera.  I can use this to take pictures of my family and save the cost of having them professionally done.  Captures everything you need.  Nothing bad about this camera at all.  Excellent lens to go with this camera."
"OR";"Great sights! Fit good flip up is great put on a archangel kit and didn't even need to sight them in dead nuts from the get go"
"OR";"I love dystopian, post-apocalyptic, survival, and disaster fiction. I took a chance on this book; the product description left me leery and I was pleasantly surprised with this book.  It was very interesting and entertaining.  Worth more than the .99 you will pay."
"OR";"We greatly enjoy putting this puzzle together. My daughter always asks what comes next. So then we sing the alphabet song.  Each puzzle piece is pretty big and they are easy to put together."
"OR";"Love this matt, bought for my daughter she can now practice her tumbling at home.  It is big enough that she can do front handsprings and back walkovers.  She is 11.  She likes to take it outside and the way it folds up makes it easier for her to move it in and out of the house."
"OR";"Great little device.  not sure how hardy it is goign to be, but a great small light source with multiple functionalities, and could be used to charge an android phone in a pinch."
"OR";"Again I find a well written and I interesting story with good characterizations and geographical descriptions. The author has obviously done his research and then threaded it together in an excellent story."
"OR";"They're comfy and I like the ""brindle"" color  (it's unique to my pant collection ). However, I ordered 38W X 29L, but when I got it, the tag inside said 38W X 30L."
"OR";"Barbara Devlin has never disappointed me with any novel I have read by her. She engrossed me in another time period and endeared me to characters effortlessly. Another wonderful book by an equally wonderful author."
"OR";"I loved this book. The characters were really entertaining. I am confused about some of the reviews that indicated that the H was not an alpha male. He was but with a heart. The story really flowed and was not overly dramatic, making it totally unbelievable. There were a few misunderstandings, but t"
"OR";"Bruder trucks and cars are the BEST toy vehicles on the market for young boys.  My 4 year old grandson has been playing with Bruder trucks for several years and still loves them."
"OR";"Well made, sturdy ornaments. Thankfully Amazon had 2012 ornament as I forgot to buy them in 2012. Purchased the 3 French hens this past Christmas. Looking forward to this collection."
"OR";"The perfect way to experience the Harry Potter world. Absolutely exquisite, I'm so impressed with the quality. I don't know why more people aren't talking about it! Can't wait for my daughter to be old enough to enjoy it with me!"
"OR";"The screws that came with them do not fit my 12-24 drilled and tap rack fastener holes.  The shelves are nice but I had to go buy 12-24 screws from a hardware store in order to install them."
"OR";"BEWARE!!!!!! THIS PRODUCT CAN CAUSE YOUR DOG HARM!!

I purchased this product because of the great reviews, even though I normally use Frontline. I followed instructions on the weight requirements, as well as where to place the liquid. About an hour after application, my dog started freaking out! He"
"OR";"Loved the shoe and loved the price!  I was hesitant to go so 'bold' but I am so glad I did!  They are cute as can be and go with so much!  Suits, dresses, everything!  They  are a change from the traditional and yet can still be worn in any business setting! Go For it!  E."
"OR";"The topper fit perfectly and is very comfortable. This is used on a spare bed that had a regular foam topper which got too warm and was uncomfortable. The feather topper provides just enough warmth where I only need one blanket which is perfect."
"OR";"I have friends who are SCCA corner workers and others who are EMTs and Firefighters. Both are jobs that can involve cutting, prying open, grabbing hot or sharp things, etc.  I saw this as a good tool to keep in my car to use ""just in case"" I had a chance to be a hero, like my friends. But first, I b"
"OR";"It was free with Amazon Prime!  I didn't purchase it.  I LOVE AMAZON PRIME!  I don't know why everyone doesn't have it!!!
Father Knows Best is a great family show that makes me happy.  I grew up watching it."
"OR";"I LOVE these!!  I bought one set and came back and got another.  I used them on my front door wreaths and lighting on my porch for Christmas.  Since I live in Florida I don't use my fireplace but decorate it and these lights are perfect!"
"OR";"Probably best for smaller dogs. The mesh and straps are very lightweight and seem comfortable, but my dog is 70 lbs and this harness didn't keep him from pulling much!"
"OR";"I always enjoy watching the bad boy meet his love match.  This was a good story - plenty of action and moved the larger story along nicely."
"OR";"This baby bottle makes cute little crying and giggling sounds. Its a little bit bigger than the usual doll's baby bottle.. Which is good, so its not so easy to lose. "
"OR";"This was SO EASY to use. If your screen is ripped this is THE only product. The tools that come with it are very helpful. My screen looks brand new. Very easy to use and well made."
"OR";"Although it fit & worked fine, this part that was shipped did not look like the picture in the description. No worries! I replaced this upper and the lower unit and saved $600.00 based on the repair estimate!"
"OR";"I got the medium size for my 15 pound Chihuahua mix. It fit under the middle seat very easily I did not have to remove the bottom like other reviews have said to do. I had no problems traveling on Southwest with this carrier"
"OR";"Works perfectly. My only qualm is that it has more ports than I need, but it was the best value of the options I reviewed so the extra ports don't bother me. Who knows, maybe I'll need them in the future - and not I have them just in case."
"OR";"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a "
"OR";"This hub works perfectly, but the seller is questionably dis/honest. After I bought and received a malfunctioning hub, the only fix offered by this seller was for me to buy another one! Yes it was more expensive and I feel ripped off."
"OR";"Putney's plots are always exciting and mixed settings (usually India and England) are described well enough to carry you there and this story is no exception.  I will definitely be reading the rest of this series."
"OR";"I gave these out for Christmas and the response was positive. It's a great gift to give dudes that doesn't cost a lot.  Pick up 5 or 6 and be ready for last minutes gifts for unexpected people."
"OR";"I do not have much time to write this review, but this book is one of the best on current world classics.  The other one I equally recommend is No One's World by Charles Kupchan"
"OR";"It is a very good looking watch. It is absolutely fantastic, the design, the material is top notch. I highly recommend it for anyone that want a smart looking watch and very classy :)"
"OR";"Works well for me. I plugged it in on the 2nd floor of a 4,000 square foot house that I own and it's great. It also lights up when the bell rings. Good value if you don't want to be bothered installing a whole new doorbell."
"OR";"Omg I loved this book series so wasn't expecting it to end like that but karma is a b*tch & revenge is always sweet especially when you messed with someone's family."
"OR";"The bag is exactly as the photo shows. It is enough to hold a few items for swimming (not the towel) as a backpack or for school (not too many items). It is nice but a little overpriced in my opinion, but being Adidas, it is to be expected."
"OR";"i love this outfit it really keeps me warm and protected from the cold wind when walking and cycling. very nice material and it looks good with my fox racing gloves and helmet."
"OR";"Exceeded what I was expecting this to be . Super cute and my daughter loves it . For all the little shimmer and shine fans this is a must have . The wrist bands fit my 3 year old perfectly with some room to grow in. You can actually use the brush as well."
"OR";"Love the MC books by this author. Every one of them are extremely well written and keeps you engaged from start to finish. Ready for the next book."
"OR";"Come on, too much of a good thing is not a good thing. Just cause someone strikes a hit with one genre, other authors try to cash in on the idea instead of being creative themselves."
"OR";"Great slingshot for the price! I was able to store 51, 3/8"" (I would recommend buying the 3/8"") steel ball bearings. I would recommend this slingshot to anyone!"
"OR";"Have always used Tachikara since middle school and have remained a faithful user since. The leather is soft and doesn't hurt your hands. Love the  various colors it comes in!"
"OR";"I liked this puzzle but found it more challenging than the average 1000-piece ravensburger puzzle. The different buildings and flowers all look so alike. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the more photographic ones but is still a good puzzzle."
"OR";"These were parts for my new home-built computer. The pricing and quick shipping made for an affordable, stress free home-build. Since the computer is working great I don't have any complaints."
"OR";"Happy I found a trilogy of TDK on DVD for such a low price. Bought as a gift for my brother who doesnt have a blu-ray player, haven't opened it yet, but looks good!"
"OR";"George takes his big city bride, Madeline, to meet the family in North Carolina. There's Meg, his mom, who's suspicious of this polished, too thin woman introduced into the family. The brother exudes resentment towards George and slumps sullenly through the film. His wife, girlishly fawns over Madel"
"OR";"I use these in my salon for applying eyelash perms and tints. I love the blue one it's so cute and matches my salon!! Just wish it had an off button. But doesn't die quickly."
"OR";"I go through a lot of riding gloves and this pair has held up much longer than usual. The gloves are very comfortable and quite durable. I will definitely buy another pair when these wear out."
"OR";"These look really nice for the price.  I would definitely recommend them for someone who is looking for a stand that doesn't take up a lot of room.
Again, great for the price"
"OR";"Product is fantastic, easy installation and gives my toilet a classy look. Matches great with the rest of our brushed nickel. Very sturdy and feels like its well made. Been using for several months now and it is still in perfect condition."
"OR";"Cool book! The kindle book looks nice, with colorful formatting. The recipes are simple, clear and creative. And the book comes with a nice bonus for freezer bag ice cream recipes. This book is a treat."
"OR";"It is exactly what it is advertised as.  A good quality D-Handle.  Works great.  Good quality, absolutely no complaints.  I bought 2.  One for my home gym and one for my local gym I use when overseas.  Cheap price too. What's not to like."
"OR";"A lot better quality then reviews made me believe.  Pieces are plastic but atleast it's solid plastic.  These other reviews made it out to be like cheap checkers pieces."
"OR";"Through the twists, turns, and love affairs....I love this sequel! It's like all of these perfect not so perfect relationships but real love and happiness creeps up on everyone except ......."
"OR";"did not do much, would cost a furtune to use for every day, i had yard sprayed for fleas and ticks, works great, yes i cheat i am a pest control guy."
"OR";"Quality collars, very impressed with the craftsmanship. Only 4 stars because the posted measurements are incorrect. They should have fit both of my dogs; one 50lbs but stocky, the other 70lbs. They could both slip out of these. I returned and ordered Medium."
"OR";"This book was purchased by a nurse to give to a young man who doesn't have a father figure in his life. His mom was concerned she was not able to provide him with the much needed information for social interaction with his peers."
"OR";"Solid action from start to finish.  I really enjoy reading a well thought out story.  The author has a great working knowledge of weapons, which was a pleasant surprise."
"OR";"Super cute, but realistically I'm not sure how anyone makes these work as advertised.  I haven't tried them myself.  My 15 yr old daughter wanted these and after trying once and it being kind of a pain they are now just taking up space in my cupboard."
"OR";"Should give this a 5 but they are a ""little"" thin and will tear.. Overall I'm happy with them and use 3-4 a day with my Pug puppy and will reorder the same product.. Let's make it 4.5...."
"OR";"Pretty good construction, but don't lean on it  when you're cleaning it, or step on it yourself....plastic cracks easily....brittle?  Internal thermostat turns it off and on with the weather, as it's supposed to. My dog loves it."
"OR";"The story about Chase and Riley is one that I must continue to find out what happens between them. Riley has been in love with Chase since she was in middle school back when he was a nobody, sounds like things can get really interesting with their story."
"OR";"I bought this after always borrowing a friends and the reason for the 4 star is this has an aluminum body as a posed to my friends brass.  Time will tell if it stands up as well or even better."
"OR";"I've had it for about 6 months now, and it still ranks as the best purchase I've ever made regarding bedding. It is hard to describe how comfortable it is over a review, but safe to say its EXTREMELY comfortable. I would not sleep as well as I do if not for this!"
"OR";"This is the second time I have purchased this film. I use it for my small round table education sessions on water.  It is worth watching, particularly for a quick lesson on transnationals and what it means to be priced out of water."
"OR";"I love westerns ..  Good entertainment . great movies  . She likes lonesome Dove so I thought  keep it going  .  We both loved it . highly recommend.."
"OR";"Love these.  I used them for a project for my granddaughter.  Since they were not expensive, they allowed lots of room for learning and/or mistakes.  She painted 5 of them in one afternoon and plans to add more to the scarves this weekend."
"OR";"Used these for donuts and other desserts in our wedding, and let our friends borrow them for their wedding too. Easy to assemble and to clean, and still looks pretty good even though it's just white plastic. Well-represented by the Amazon pictures."
"OR";"I wore out my first pair of ASICS Gel-Nimbus shoes and wanted a replacement pair. I use them for walking, light jogging and cross training. I am very pleased with the support and comfort of this shoe. I would definitely purchase them again."
"OR";"I have used this stuff for years and it works great. Caught 22 bluegill on 1 dry fly last Friday and fly stayed dry! This is good stuff."
"OR";"I'm 42B bra size, got a 3X and it is too snug. Nice bra for price, well made. But sizing runs really small."
"OR";"Works great, no problems at all, unlike the other Star Wars guns.

The ""cocking"" mechanism is a bit tough for younger kids, but it seems to be loosening up and getting easier."
"OR";"I've used Reebok trainers in the past so I was surprised these shoes were somewhat smaller than my other Reeboks. Quality is very good tho, I used these on a night out (I quite don't remember) and on the next day they were still very much intact."
"OR";"I liked this book, I like the building storyline between Reyes and Charlie and by this book I am used to the sarcasm and sass of the main character... now it's expected and endearing. I also really enjoyed the family dynamic. The characters feel real and vibrant."
"OR";"Another movie I had to have, saw this on and thought it was great. Heard this was Drew Barrymore's debut as a director and thought Ellen Page did a great acting job in this one."
"OR";"Turns out my dog isn't a bone chewer, but my sister's dog chewed this thing down to a nub in a week!  Not too messy or smelly either. Great bone to keep a chewer busy for days."
"OR";"These worked great to make flavored ice cubes for my tea.  I love the size of them . The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays once they are frozen . Just make sure you have enough space in your freezer to let them set ."
"OR";"Perfect size for my 12 lb chihuahua who is lean.  I was really unsure what to do with the sizing on here but decided to trust the chart and it fits like it was made for her.  She's wearing a medium.  Color is true to photo."
"OR";"Fairy Daffodil looks just like she looks in the pictures. She fits snugly in her pouch and it can be easily hung just about anywhere. The zipper is kid-friendly. I wasn't worried about little fingers getting hurt."
"OR";"Super cute, goes with an egyptian costume I purchased. It's not too tall (I'm 5'7"") and it breaks down so it can fit into the car easily.  Pretty gold color. Was great for my costume."
"OR";"they're very nice what I expected just a tool set I like the way the sets stack and snap together I like everything about it although  The yellow lids I fear if you're not careful they might crack easy"
"OR";"It's alright.  The hair catcher doesn't stay put when washing hair in the sink, but this is just my situation.  This may work well for others.  The item is well made, with small ""teeth"" to catch hairs."
"OR";"I love this watch!  It's smaller than expected but very well made and I love the colors as well.  I think I may have found a new favorite watch designer."
"OR";"The color nothing like the picture
The shirt is small I'm 5'2 120 pnds and Medium didn't fit! The fabric is silk see true
Buyer be ware!"
"OR";"This was a lifesaver when I was adjusting my pom puppy to her new home! She was stressed and didn't eat much, but LOVES this stuff. Be careful not to get it in their hair! She was so excited for it she ran right into it and got it in there. It was super hard to brush out."
"OR";"This was another great story in this series. I cannot wait for the next book. If you like strong female characters and their alpha male loves you will enjoy this series."
"OR";"Stories that impart to the reader the feel of the Code of Conduct that once prevailed in the nature of western American culture.  I enjoyed reading all 9 novels and recommend this set to those who like a good western."
"OR";"Because the spatula is molded in one piece, it is sturdy and easy to clean. It's not as flexible as my other spatulas, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem.  This thing is impervious to heat--you can use it in a pot or pan right on the stove."
"OR";"This read had so much secrets and lies all through this family . Dysfunctional to the fullest . Its crazy how the parents tried to keep there family business away from the girls but it didn't work . I wonder if in part 2 will they get it together"
"OR";"I hope DAMION DIETZ, the director, will continue making movies.  And, I hope this film will someday make it to DIGITAL DOWNLOAD on this website (and others).  CARBS IS BAD, but I love me some BEEFCAKE.  Mmmm.  : )  WOOF!"
"OR";"This a decent bag. It's the right size for the tools I have. The shoulder strap was what made this the winner over similar bags. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have internal pockets. Otherwise, I am satisfied with this purchase!"
"OR";"This glass product is clear glass.  You can see inside so you know what you left inside the last time you used it.  It works good, the lid keeps the flies out."
"OR";"While very occasionally awkward, this book succeeded in pulling me into its world. I felt like I was there. I understood the characters emotions, motivations, and had enough background on them that I was along for the ride. What an awesome and epic two part story!"
"OR";"This product is exactly what I wanted when I read the specs and ordered it. I have had no problems with it, and I highly recommend it. I was also happy to know in advance, before placing the order, that there were no shipping charges."
"OR";"19C Russian literature at its best. Great e-book version. Easy to locate by chapter or last page read. This is a large book that doesn't fit in your pocket or purse - great on my Samsung Galaxy 5."
"OR";"Generations, several years pass throughout this book.  Tragedies of the worst imaginable kind.  WWII sadness, hardships and death.  Great story that follows one common denominator - Pegasus!"
"OR";"I am really pleased with the whisks and glad I ordered them. As for their appearance I like there warm cheery colors and the handles are comfortable in the hand. They perform well while using them and cleaning them is a breeze. They will not harm the coating on your skillets."
"OR";"For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old pupp"
"OR";"we think that even in our partially shaded yard, this light should be able to gather enough energy to light the flag the entire night. it doesn't. if you buy it, you'll have a better than average chance of being disappointed."
"OR";"we have been DeNiro fans for some time, had seen the move before, and really wanted it in my library. So far we have watched it a couple of time and our neighbors borrowed it so they could view it again.  So glad that Amazon has the old favorites."
"OR";"My son loves this book and loves to read it several times a day. The pages feel flimsy and tear easier than I would hope."
"OR";"Quality built. Handle can be detached from the hook driver. Hook driver can be used with a cordledd drill. Standard size screw driver bits will fit into handle. I'd buy it again."
"OR";"Great for carpet stairs, though not as great for wood stairs. Tends to scratch them a bit with the plastic casing for the brush. Extremely happy though how it picks up dog hair so easily :)."
"OR";"Well if you're like me you will get the queen size in when you ordered the king. Even the package said king size. The material felt good, but to no avail."
"OR";"This is a great car for the small kids but the bigger kids liked it to it's fast.
I recommended it to all my friends and family.
Great product and great customer service!"
"OR";"The story of Damali Richards is a bit cliche...the ""chosen"" guardian of humanity against the forces of evil...she's a girl who falls for the wrong guy...the guy is killed by vampires and becomes on of the walking dead...yadda yadda yadda.  So, what makes L. A. Banks' story so interesting?

The most "
"OR";"Nice basic bar ends. They installed easily and seem sturdy. Time will tell if they are durable. Only fault is the plastic caps are a bit loose fitting and may not last long."
"OR";"I think that this is a great toy for a one+ year old.  She pushes the buttons and something happens...noises, music or talking.  As she gets older, she will better understand how to use the toy to facilitate her learning. And it is durable enough to last until she is older!"
"OR";"Awesomen for a Keltec KSG they feel and look sturdy and don't have some tacky emblem on them. Proper height for a comfortable cheek weld. Way better than any polymer sights you can pick up."
"OR";"Nice, small, good featured radio. Only thing I don t like is you cannot silently set the alarm, it makes some annoying beeps when you try to set it, at least I haven't figured out how not to. But it is a very nice clock and the radio sounds good too."
"OR";"I enjoyed the story ok but I was disappointed in how short it was, how it ended and how I never really understood the guys with the guns.  This is the first book I have read by Susan that I was not thrilled to read.  I will not buy the next 2 in this series.  I felt overcharged for so little ."
"OR";"I bought this product a year ago. I got the pink one and it's  quite eye catching. But beyond that, it does what it promises to do. Nothing changed with the product and it does protect my Ipod touch. It's sturdy and comfortable to use. I will recommend it to anyone."
"OR";"Loved it! Somehow I managed to miss it all those years ago -- but I missed a lot of good, great and bad movies in that period of my life. I particularly enjoyed all the Simon and Garfunkle music throughout the film, and how well it fit."
"OR";"Omigosh, these are simply stunning and clearly well made. Arrived in a box within a box, canvas is perfectly taut and the coloring is really beautiful. They are a wonderful compliment to my bathroom."
"OR";"We bought this for the porch light while we were out of town. It turns out that my son and daughter in law stayed at the house, so it wasn't needed, but we're using it anyway because it is so convenient. It works perfectly."
"OR";"This Leek is awesome, sexy, and smooth just like my wife. I bought it on a great lightning deal during the holidays, too bad my wife lost it a week after she opened it on Christmas day."
"OR";"Engrossing, quick read.  I enjoyed it very much.  I am going to Savannah this weekend (9/18) and am taking the book tour.  Sad to hear The Lady Chablis died a couple of weeks ago."
"OR";"My granddaughter dropped this one time from about two feet up onto the hardwood floor and it never worked again. Don't waste your money. I'd give it a minus star if I could."
"OR";"Yes the chain is a little light, but the pearl itself is wonderful, WELL WORTH the price because no one I know thinks it is anything but real!!  1 of my friends even told me it would pay for her 1 month mortgage!!"
"OR";"These are *great*. Replaced an ancient set of 10"" Fischer speakers that had been with me since college (they were circuit breaker protected, fortunately!). These are primarily used for theater fronts, and they have great sound."
"OR";"Compatible with iPhone. I like the PJ2-4B-GWH-L01 better.

The PJ2-4B-GWH-L01 has dimming capabilities.

Lutron makes the best lighting controls in the world A+,  their software however I must give a B+"
"OR";"Converse is usually a safe bet, but these literally fell apart with normal wear in under a month. Bought them ahead of time as a gift, so by the time my son wore them, return date had passed."
"OR";"I have a 2004 Toyota 4Runner and could not figure out how to fit this after several tries. I even had a friend try to see if they could fit it and it just would not work with the bungee cords that came with the barrier. It may just be my car though :/"
"OR";"My Granddaughter is a big One Direction fan and she loved the comforter and sheet set.  Put them on her bed on Christmas day and her mom is having trouble getting them off to wash."
"OR";"What is to be said about the Duke and comedy.  In one of his best performances ever we get to see the comedic side of this great actor.  Also, this movie features the absolute bare-knuckle fight ever put on the big screen."
"OR";"Not at all what I was expecting. This was a large box of plastic pieces that don't fit together. I'm sure the only way this toy would be usable is if you glued the pieces together."
"OR";"I'm very happy with this 4tb drive - I'm using a two year old iMac with Snow Leopard as my Operating System and haven't experienced any glitches or problems."
"OR";"This was a great read. Not too smutty, a wonderful path of complication to keep things interesting. I do think the build up to the ""Judah"" situation was a bit much for the outcome, but it didn't kill the book. I still liked it, in fact I couldn't put it down."
"OR";"You'd be better off working through Competitive Strategy by Michael Porter, there's nothing in here that isn't in Porter's book. This books is a little easier to read for the casual reader however and does have more examples to explain the topics."
"OR";"It was not put together already so we spent a long time attempting to create each tassel which was an extremely tedious process. I do not recommended this product unless you have time to put it together before hand."
"OR";"My son said it would be perfect for his 5 year old son's birthdays, my grandson was excited but we know who will be assembling it especially since my son also grew iPad with Legos.  They never disappoint."
"OR";"Bought this crane for my three-year-old son's birthday. He absolutely loves it!  This is one of those toys that can be played with in 100 different ways. Not only is it fun for my son, but it's been fun for  us adults to play with too!  Some assembly required, but that was half the fun  ;)"
"OR";"Wow, this book was excellent! Hated the fact that London Didn't go to Reese with her problem, but it all worked out! Must read, emotional, passionate, sexy read!!!!"
"OR";"These are great to wear under dresses over the summer. They aren't uncomfortably tight, material is airy, and they stay in place. I have bought a few and have recommended them to friends, who also like they very much."
"OR";"I so enjoyed the main characters of girl and dragons. Their relationships and details of their colorful world and interrelationships was described clearly in spite of being very complex. If you like dragons, you'll enjoy the book. I'm off to buy the second book now."
"OR";"Friends and family know my husband too well. He got duplicates! They look very useful. I don't sew but I think they would work for pins  needles, and tape measure"
"OR";"This book was written with characters around mid twenties to thirties.but the language and content of the book is perfect for young teens, middle school or high school.
Or maybe just shallow adults."
"OR";"Very good as a debut novel! So many questions I need answered but I don't want to spoil the book! This book had me really into it! If I was the type to cry over a book I would've went through a whole box tissue! Great job Jade!"
"OR";"This is a gift requested by my grandson for his birthday.  We have used real dominoes to do this, but without the props.  Some reviews say the parts are flimsy, so be forewarned.  This is for an older child who is not hard on his toys."
"OR";"This company keeps changing their door size standards so every time you buy a replacement, it
doesn't fit.

we're going to just buy a whole new back door and start over.
highly UNRECOMMENDED!

Purchase with caution."
"OR";"Read Cat Haus first then definitely read this book. It gets you into John's head and mind set. Cate and John two unlikely folks to fall in love. I would really like to see more to this story line."
"OR";"My cats seemed to like this at first, but now I haven't seen them on it since. They don't use it as a scratcher either, they just use it as a lounge. The product itself is fine, my kitties are just picky."
"OR";"All 3 of my grandkids love these.  They said it makes a big difference in seeing under water, the way they fit and feel and recommend that these are the ones that I buy in the future."
"OR";"Love this series was one of the best I have read.  The author has out done her self with details n keeping u interested in the book n series."
"OR";"This is a nice little kitty condo.  Easy to put together and fairly sturdy.  It appears that it will last for quite some time in good condition and the kitty loves it."
"OR";"Her books are truly laugh our loud funny. I love them all and I truly have laughed at inopportune times and locations. Bottom line, she is hysterical to read and she will definitely tickle your funny bone."
"OR";"My 4 year-old loves to play Yarn Kirby. It's a really cute and creative looking game. Pretty easy for younger kids to play as well."
"OR";"This is my first ZELITE knife and it won't be my last. The shape of the handle and blade are great, the fit and finish are a pleasant surprise for a knife in this price point, and it arrived sharp! I will be looking into the rest of their stuff very soon!"
"OR";"A different take on the possible end of the world as we know it.  How tragedy can bring people together.  Great characters and very interesting plot line.  Couldn't put it down.  Glad it was a stand alone novel."
"OR";"They fit snug but that is part of why they do such a great job preventing hotspots and blisters-- no more sliding around! I love them for the gym and mowing the lawn. I also appreciate that they are made in America."
"OR";"I only needed 5 but for the price this was a better deal. The fit in various bottles and work exactly as expected; nice smooth pour without any dripping or popping from bubbles."
"OR";"My 8 month old is in love with this sweet Seahorse. Is is the perfect soother for her crib and helps her fall to sleep peacefully. The music is very sweet and the glow of the light is just right."
"OR";"A feel good book. I didn't want to put it down because I wanted to know what would happen next. Will definitely recommend this book to friends and family."
"OR";"I love this case for my Motorola Razr phone. Sturdy case for
the phone and I have dropped the phone a few times.
It takes the hit and keep going.
Would recommend for your phone."
"OR";"I am a triplet and thought my great grandaughter would like to learn about twins.
It also teachs about planting a garden. It just looked like a fun game of learning."
"OR";"My puppy did not care for these much but my older dog ate it in one seating. Approx 10 minutes to devour for the 13 year old Sheltie. I would not purchase again."
"OR";"This movie gives another look into history from a prospective I've never considered. I like that. If u r intelligent, mature and care about history you just might enjoy this movie as much as I did. Simply not s kids movie."
"OR";"Nice harness for canines, I use this as a car harness when driving as well as a walking harness. Well sewn together, the cloth chest piece is padded and worth the price to protect my girl."
"OR";"These are probably the best bluetooth headphones around.  Light, attractive, work extremely well, easy to pair......what more can I say...I love these.  Bought a second pair."
"OR";"Great! I can actually hear the individual instruments on what I am listening to. I love getting really hammered on the weekends and watching Youtube and these Etymotic earphones make my buzz more enjoyable"
"OR";"The first one was a hit so I purchased another one for the family room.hold enough water for 2days for 2 dogs!  No splashing water on the floor anymore."
"OR";"These different flavor small milk bones is the way to go for when it is bed time it a snack but not enough to require a extra drink of batter. So perfect for nighty night time."
"OR";"Beware!! I purchased this a year ago and just bought a second one. It's supposed to be the exact same item, but the new one is very flimsy and much smaller. I'm going to try to return it. I doubt this new version will hold up."
"OR";"this game was enjoyable and it worked well

im glad that i orderd this because i used it when i was bored but i would not have bought it if it was any amount of money because it was not that good

that is what i thought of the game ""HAMSTER HABITAT""
and why i think that u should get it aslong as the"
"OR";"This baby has the cutest face! She is not to heavy, and not to light, he is perfect in that way! Her hair is a bit stif, an fall a lot, but I think I have to cut a little, comes to big! Her mouth is not magnetic! I bought this to my daughter, and she loves it! I think she is beautiful!"
"OR";"As with the second book, this book was a great continuation from the previous book.  The down side is that the story doesn't end with this book and you find out that there will be two more books."
"OR";"My only complaint about this set is that is constantly falls apart at the hinge.  Even though I have to reassemble it regularly, my 4-year-old loves it and has spent quite a bit of time playing with it since Christmas."
"OR";"Great thick quality! Well made. I never go wrong with Carhartt, have made many many purchases for many years. Never disappoint."
"OR";"AWESOME...TOTALLY AWESOME!! Loved the ""choices"" ...such creativity...oh my can't wait for next book...meantime am thinking I will go back and reread the zero books......and that says a lot, I rarely reread...the only other books I have reread are the Tolkien books"
"OR";"Great writing.  I love the Virgil Flowers series.  There's suspense but also a lot of ""off the cuff"" remarks that make you laugh out loud.  Wish there were more in the series!"
"OR";"From reading previous reviews, I knew the size would be a bit smaller. It is a thin blanket that attracts a ton of hair. Soft but my dog prefers regular throw blankets that are thicker."
"OR";"Not a bad movie, not a great movie. Predictable fun, not scary, lots of fake blood, didn't make me jump, I let my 14yr watch it and she was fine with it."
"OR";"I love period pieces, and this one definitely kept my interest.  This is worth seeing and now we started Season 2 on PBS Sunday nights.  It started Mach 30."
"OR";"This book was recommended by a friend and I use it in teaching my nursing students and as a reference.  It is the best reference I have found on EKG Interpretation, making it simpler to understand than other books"
"OR";"Beejays has this wonderful easy to use spiralizer. It helps to minimize the prep time for your food preparation. Spiralizer is sleek and durable. It is compact enough to fit in your kitchen drawers. It comes with a cleaning brush and a free rotary peeler. This peeler has three blades for various cut"
"OR";"This is an excellent knife!  The quality is first rate.  The slim profile is handy to carry in my pocket of in a sheath.  My only criticism is that there are no scissors.  Other than that I'm very happy with this item.  I highly recommended this product."
"OR";"This is a replacement lens for the one I lost/misplaced. I purchased two just in case I lose/misplace it again. This time, I'm using one of those elastic holders and glueing on the cap! Not much I can say except that it's just like the original and that's all I can ask of it."
"OR";"Best of the X-men series by far.  I wish Matthew Vaughn had directed the first 3 of them too.  Almost enough to make up for the crapfest that was Brett Ratner's X-Men Last Stand."
"OR";"""The Facts of Life"" is one of those great television shows that defined the 80s. It had comedy but easily tackled issues young people were facing such as drugs, sex, and simply morals and things like self-esteem.

This DVD release does what few first season sets don't; it packs in two seasons, inclu"
"OR";"My fifth mora. There is no better Knife value than mora. Period. There may be some that are more survival oriented or that have a fancier steel Or sheath, but not better value. I got this one for camping food slicing and as a backup to my woodsy knife that literally cost more than 10x more. This has"
"OR";"Max finally killed Captain Kurklops. The last of his stuffing was in my hallway when I came home yesterday. He now happily carries around the rag wherever he goes.

This and Polly pig were his first set of Tuffy brand toys. Polly pig is still going strong a month later, minus one of her ears.

When "
"OR";"Great DVD that was direct to content and was as expected.  The shipping on time, previous reviews just and unbiased.  Price per item always a plus and reasonable.  Quality of viewing content unflawed."
"OR";"I have an ASUS transporter tablet and my original cord when bad. I needed a new one and I order it through Amazon. I am very pleased with the cord, and if I ever need a another one I will definitely come to Amazon."
"OR";"He's Baack! Arnold plays a good guy robo who saves the day (s)
I thought another T-Movie where they shoot mountains of ammo
 but it was actually a pretty decent movie. A dirrerent for oarnold."
"OR";"I would love to love this because it was fun for a little while but a little while was less than half an hour.  My 3 year old granddaughter managed to break it that quickly."
"OR";"Our small Dorkie loves this brand and this is her newest and now her favorite. She chews all over it but it's still in good shape. The squeaker in the tail was the first to stop working because of the chewing but there are two more to enjoy. This is the main brand for our slightly gentle dog."
"OR";"As most of the others have said, this lens is awesome. I got it and with in the first 10 minutes I was taking some of the best portrait shots I have taken to date. If you have the $ even if you need to borrow it, get this lens"
"OR";"i usually love these mysteries,but this one isn't up to snuff..Too much chase and not enough mystery. Although it gave a little more information in relation to the Crawfords as in Beth."
"OR";"I'm a writer, and this book, this introduction to another culture, is beautifully written. There were times that I became so emotionally involved with this book that I had to put it down and do something else. It's a novel. But I believe it to be autobiographical, too. If you ever had any questions "
"OR";"This worked perfectly to make a quick but effective Klingon forehead for my nephew for his Lt. Worf costume this past Halloween.  It dries quickly and without much form change, and sticks to itself well."
"OR";"Worked as stated cleared my issue on one camera and the other turned out to be a bad camera...The third was the bnc touching my alum. trim on soffit caused another ground.. All happy now.."
"OR";"I love the cover of this book and knew that the content would be just as lovely...and I wasn't wrong.
Fire and Ice by Mary Connealy is a fun read.  I love Bailey Wilde (and it's interesting that this is a Wild at Heart series and Bailey's last name is Wilde!)...hmmm.
Bailey is/has been disguised as "
"OR";"The only thing I did wrong was one time I put too much in my goggles and didn't smear it around enough so it got into my eyes and burned. But that was a user error not a product fault."
"OR";"Be careful and take it easy with this thing. I did three sinks and got all kinds of nasty stuff out. But on the fourth sink it got completely stuck and I had to take the drain apart to get it out. They ARE REUSABLE also."
"OR";"My 7 month old loves his Caterpillar! He enjoys shaking it up and down so he can hear the rattlers. He also loves the different textures and gnawing on the antennas (they are barley over an inch so I don't worry about him gagging on them. It is one of his favorite toys!"
"OR";"I was very satisfied with these lights having instant brightness when they came on, but then without any warning they just went out and would not come back on. They were only on my garage for 1 year. I will not take another chance buying this brand again."
"OR";"Works great every time. Solid build great styling and easy to install and program. Will buy another for back door."
"OR";"I am an elderly handicapped woman and I love this.  Very easy for me to use and I have used it a few times already.  Just put it on the charger - came pre charged and worked immediately."
"OR";"Love this screen, easy to install and works perfect. i recommend this to anyone who loves fresh air. I am disabled and have cancer and it only took me 30 minutes to install"
"OR";"Castle is one of the best or the best series on TV at this time.  I have watched since the begining and hope the series will continue for season 7  Have alreaady preordered season 6"
"OR";"Liked the preview enough that I bought the book.  I will let you know what I thought when I finish.  Just finished the book and can say I definitely enjoyed it.  Keep them coming."
"OR";"Works great and excellent customer service from Wen. I ordered 2 units. The remote in one of them did not work. Called Wen and they sent me a new remote."
"OR";"This is the most comfortable bra I have ever worn.  The soft elastic fits your form snugly without constraint and the straps do not slide down.  I liked this so much that I purchased 2 more in different colors."
"OR";"This is the best, I've had and used it for a few months.  The finest rack I've ever had.  I show it to all friend male/female and when I brag about it they laugh at me... It cleans so easily, I pour water on it and dry it with a towel, looks like new..."
"OR";"Awesome deal for the price. I light my grill with these all the time. It only takes me a few shavings to get the rest of the fire bundled going. For what I use it for it will last me a long time"
"OR";"Great thinline Bible... John MacArthur corrected this edition, so it is more accurate, using both the Greek & Jewish trsnslations. =)  There isn't any commentary, but that is what keeps it thin! The larger print is nice, too."
"OR";"Planet Dog................need I say more?  Made in the USA, safe for your pet, if a dog doesn't like Planet Dog toys, they won't like any toys!  My three are sold on Planet Dog!"
"OR";"Eliminates big bulky dressers, thank goodness.  I was able to trash my big ugly wooden dresser, at last.  Great stuff, high quality, have owned mine for almost a year now."
"OR";"works perfectly. the range and sensitivity is what I expect. this product must continuously improve in quality and price. the only concern i have is the screw they use is so soft and easily dugged out by strong screw driver. overall this is highly recommendable."
"OR";"Kept coffee warm for hours. fits car cup holder nicely. DID NOT fit under the Keurig brewer.:(  I just brew into another cup and pour into the travel mug. I would buy again."
"OR";"This book will make you feel dirty from the first page on. Like gotta take a shower but you still can't get the filth off you. Loved it."
"OR";"Comfortable inside he pants holster that fits my bodyguard 380 perfectly. I love how comfortable it is to wear, how secure my pistol is and the concealability it provides...would definitely recommend. I also have this same holster for my glock 27, perfect."
"OR";"This is easy to put together and nice looking, for a cat drinking fountain.  But the motor is noisy--could hear it over the TV in the next room--and our cats were not interested in it at all.  Sent it back."
"OR";"You grow up believing one thing. Knowing that when you get older that your life will be as you have planned. What a joke life hardly ever turns out the way you plan. Simon learned that lesson the hard way."
"OR";"This is my second pair. The others lasted over two years with swim aerobics 3X/week year round. They were still in fairly good shape after that time, just became looser."
"OR";"After I received these I realized that they go on the outside of the window. This will not work for my applications. I do like the maple leaf look so I was sad. I am sending this to the thrift shop and hope someone else can use it!"
"OR";"works well - do not put near any heat it will warp the mat. accidently got too close to a pan and warped the edge. Most of it smoothed out but there are still some bumps. Still usable so all is good."
"OR";"This is a nice solid, heavy cabinet pull.  The satin nickel finish is good.  It was very easy to replace existing hardware.  I would highly recommend this product."
"OR";"I was looking at similar style in a department store and it cost twice as much if not more...I live in Vancouver, what do you expect!  As a mom. i have to look for something affordable but nice.  The pants suit  my son perfectly..."
"OR";"Nice to find these replacements, so I didn't have to buy a whole new pair of sunglasses. Kind of expensive for a pair of little rubber things, but cheaper than new glasses."
"OR";"I love anything written by this author. I have read a lot of her books and I have not been disappointed.  If ghost-type stories are your genre, I highly recommend anything written by this lady!"
"OR";"Good fit and comfortable, I guess the ""all day pant"" title is well earned. Already bought another pair now that I know that they fit well."
"OR";"Great for small projects. I bought to repair a lawn mower deck.  Haven't used it a lot but paid for itself in one job and nice to have around."
"OR";"It is so much better than those heavy chain choke collars.  The rings are a tough fit sliding one end through, but that makes it even lighter weight, not bad."
"OR";"The quality was so bad it was laughable. The plastic is so flimsy that it won't latch shut without a  gap. Not exactly going to seal in the freshness. Also, the plastic ""hinges"" look really fragile. I'm returning it."
"OR";"This is a nice plant. It has a good solid base that keeps it well-anchored in the gravel, and it looks quite real. However,  I  think it would have been cheaper to buy it in the store than purchasing it online, since they do occasionally go on sale."
"OR";"Purchased this knife a few months back, and there's no regrets.  High quality product.  Will defer to the better reviews on here, as it was due to them that we got it for batoning wood and such.  Its been holding up like a wolf in the darkness that's for damn sure."
"OR";"These are a great first pair of binoculars for your nature exploring child. They are made especially for kids hands and eyes and are very durable in their design. My only complaint is that they only magnify 2x, I wish they magnified more."
"OR";"Very surprised to see how well it was made, and heavier than I thought it would be.  My kittens enjoy the feeling, and I try to brush them very lightly so I don't hurt their undercoat too much."
"OR";"I kind of wanted a little more - once I had gotten past the part of the book which in the beginning was kind of freaky, I guess I wanted more, it sort of cut you off just when u began to feel for the characters."
"OR";"light enough for everyday school backpack. core i3 fast enough for everyday normal use. it is perfect for all student. Unless you are developing large application or hard gamer. This one is just right."
"OR";"I gave this to my four year old grandson for Christmas.  He loves it and couldn't wait to get home to start playing with it.  It worked well with his other wooden tracks."
"OR";"Really love this bra. Material is really thick and not cheap. Did not expect that. Its just a little tight on the sides I guess order one size bigger."
"OR";"These tools are well constructed.  They have wood handles and metal ends.  The metal is held on to the handle with a screw so they should hold up well to many hours of toddler use in the garden."
"OR";"My son and grandson absolutely love Star Wars.  You can't go wrong buying this set or any other set.  Great price for a great toy."
"OR";"My usual size is size 8P, but I can also wear an 8R. These pants were too baggy around thighs and longer than a crop pant.  I am short and curvy but these jeans made me look frumpy."
"OR";"I'm long past using calculus, but I've given to my son in hopes he would see the fine way that calculus is explained in this book.  I'll still look at it from time to time to play with the concepts and sample problems."
"OR";"I bought to use as a smaller decorative piece for my cocktail table and I couldn't be more pleased with the item. The balls are brown, gold and cream which look just lovely on the wooden tray. Looks far more expensive than what I paid for it."
"OR";"My son loves paint with water.  These are really cute and have plenty of adorable pictures.  The paint requires a lot of water to actually work, and then the paper just gets way too wet, but they are fine to keep him occupied for a bit."
"OR";"Wow. This for me is just vastly better than War and Peace. Instead of trying to sketch the entire Russian world, here he focuses in on 2-3 interrelated families. The psychological depth Tolstoy creates for Anna, Vronsky, Levin and all the rest of these people is just incredibly vivid. You feel their"
"OR";"I have used Irwin products for years and this one simply doesn't measure up --- several of the extractor bits have broken during use suggesting casting / production problems."
"OR";"I use my Blendtec at least once a day. I make my own smoothies, soups and hummus that is cheaper and healthier than what I can buy. I wish I had gotten one years ago!!!"
"OR";"This is a great tool to determine if the problem is a bad charger, or a bad battery. One can also detect if the capacity of a battery is starting to decline and prepare to replace the battery before it is completely dead."
"OR";"I heard this was great to keep doggies' teeth tarter free, but my dogs hate it. They act like it's the worse thing I've ever put in their mouths."
"OR";"I cannot say enough about this blender. This is my second one (just wanted the updated version due to the extra blade and the more sealed up top) and I use it nearly daily for protein shakes. Convenient, easy clean up."
"OR";"It looks really nice, but maybe it is something to do with teh shape of my feet, the right heel comes out a bit and sometimes feels uncomfortable.. Love the fact that it is velcro and don't have to tie them whenever it comes loose"
"OR";"Loved the characters. Teen sweethearts grow up to be a plus sized model and the bad boy is a sheriff. The plot has lots going on. More than reuniting a lost love and where it leads is not what you expect."
"OR";"I can't say how much I love this book.  I love the characters! I've read it like 9 times! I feel like I fell in love with these characters and like to be near them. it's so different and imaginative too. it's my favorite book...my go too comfort book."
"OR";"My 2 year old loves play-doh. These just enhance the experience for him. The scissors aren't used yet which I think is understandable. I bought more colors to go with this so he has more options."
"OR";"I really like this thermal. I don't put it in the microwave, though. I heat the water and then pour it in the thermal. I take it with me out in the cold and tea stays hot for hours. It won't spill in my bag at all!

Just love it."
"OR";"Needs improvement on design, once toddler fall asleep which is very easily, the system doesn't support her body well and the main rider have to use one hand to support her head, dangerously."
"OR";"great acting delivers a messeage and a great story  well done  you will enjoy this movie  it is easy to see this texas actor as the oscor  winner  he is"
"OR";"I initially bought a medium size for my pug/terrier mix. WAY too small for his broad chest. I ended up returning it and purchased an XL for him. It fits wonderfully and seems to be comfortable for him, with room to adjust if I need it. This is a great harness!"
"OR";"Bought this to replace the Canon OEM cap when I lose it...it's just a matter of when. Pinch mechanism works well and fits just as well as original. Bought this for a Canon 18-135mm STM lens and would certainly recommend."
"OR";"Love this toy! It's great for attaching to things like the stroller bar on our stroller! I love it's portability and that it easily attaches to things because of the coil like shape!"
"OR";"This is a great family game or a fun party game. We received it as a Christmas gift from my in laws and it was quickly a family favorite. It's fun just for me and my husband to play or for the whole family to join in."
"OR";"Love this for taking either hot or cold liquids to work. Keeps it hot or cold for a  long time. Nice to have spoon that comes with it and stays on top of the lid."
"OR";"I love that I now have 2 8 inch pans to bake 2 layer cakes, it helps a lot and I like that it's not a flimsy material that would get dented fast"
"OR";"This was an awesome shirt. Fits well and is very comfortable. It actually looks like dress shirt but I use it on my construction site and it looks and feels great!"
"OR";"I like these. They provide compression as advertised. The material is thick enough to do the job and provide enough coverage to protect ones modesty. The Capri length is great for those who have shorter legs."
"OR";"Horrible ""absorbency""  In no way does this product compare to the disposable wraps they sell at Petsmart. It's a shame I can't buy a better quality, better absorbency wrap on Amazon :("
"OR";"This product is perfect for dresses you don't use often.  For  me this means it's in the extra bedroom closet.  The frameless part is a bit odd but I know it won't break, and the plastic is extra heavy duty."
"OR";"Good Gauge, Excellent connectors, Quality product. Very pleased. This says that I need 12 more words to submit this but I am sure the first eight clearly describes my feelings."
"OR";"Great curtains! Thick and great quality! Blocks out light and quite a bit of sound.  It's hard finding blackouts at such a long length. Very pleased."
"OR";"Bought as gift for bear loving person. big hit. great quality and lots of details in the figurine. have bought several products from this mfg."
"OR";"I purchased this with the single intention of Vudu Disc-to-Digital.  For that purpose it works great.  It is a little loud for my taste, and heats up quickly. Which makes me glad i am not using it for other purposes."
"OR";"This dress runs on the small side (I wear a 12 and it was snug in the thigh area). It is also thin. If you have any problem areas then go up a size or two. The dress is adorable and is versitile."
"OR";"My 4 yr old grandson was able to do the his on his own. They turn out really nice. Good for a bday present. I've bought about 6 different ones. Very satisfied."
"OR";"This is a great price for a filter.  It appears to be glass and protects well.  Hasn't scratched so far.  I would recommend it instead of the very high prices some stores charge."
"OR";"This is very nice. I like it a lot, and hope to wear it on occasion in the future. It would especially go with a red and black outfit, probably any tones of red. It stretches to fit."
"OR";"This is a really cool little ladder. It is bendable and the screws twist so they're easy to move around through the bars to hook them. I had no issues with mold etc like some of the other people, thankfully. All in all, as advertised!"
"OR";"Great quality and tremendous warm from the thick liner, which takes away a half size front and back. So, you need to order one whole size larger. I expect to get many years of cozy use out of these."
"OR";"I Have 16yrs Pounding Nails For A Living, And In All My Years As A Tool Junkie I've Never
Found A Tool As Helpful As The Little Winbag.  Buy Them In Pairs, You'll Thank Me Later."
"OR";"I was recommended this shower filter by a friend. I was not expecting much. But even after the first use, I amazingly could feel the difference. Water warmer and it feels better on my skin. Totally happy with this shower filter."
"OR";"Love this litter-product disposal system...have had it for five years and it's still going ""strong"" (with NO bad smells, that is!).  The price was reasonable for this dozen of refill cartridges and the delivery was quick and fast!"
"OR";"Really enjoyed these two stories.  Both were intertaining ,lovable, an caring. Both like a fairy tale.  Lite hearted n very enjoyable.  Thanks for the good read."
"OR";"cant beat it! just wish it had some more social sharing features like ps4 but they will get there.. Every update gets better especially with the external hard drive support now.."
"OR";"The dogs line up for these, which we call dessert and distribute after their dinner.  They are truly of the opinion that these are just like people treats and can't get enough.  The legend on the back of the bag is charming and fun, and the whole idea is sweet."
"OR";"This knife is very thoroughly reviewed so I will just say that after several years of carrying it 5 days a week on average, I'm very pleased. It's not a great looking knife in my opinion but it's a very good all around edc that holds and performs up well."
"OR";"Good for labs, beagles...all furr kiddos with droopy ears. 7f you don't have this in your veterinary supply kit, you should.  We got a new pup who kept scatching his ears, this sure soothed him until we got him cleated up."
"OR";"Smaller than I expected, but still beautiful. Given to a WI native who loves the game, and has never upgraded his board or pegs. With his large hands, these are easier to grab at the top."
"OR";"good product did its job but 6 months is a 3 month stretch . 3 months are all I get out of the filter then finding the refill at a good price is terrible"
"OR";"I like it but it's too big for most garbage bags. I have to use an oversized bag for a liner. As in other reviews, it came dented. How can the company keep shipping these without putting them in a decent box?"
"OR";"This looks exactly like the witch in the Room on the Broom book and DVD!  It has the official tag saying it is a Room on the Broom character!  My grandson will love it for Christmas!"
"OR";"Really great dog food; I was excited to have my dogs try this! Grain-Free Dry Dog & contains no corn, by-product meals or artificial ingredients. It has good meat & veggies in it which is healthy. MY dogs seem to love it!"
"OR";"It doesn't stay in place well. After a number of hot water experiences it still does not lie flat. The suction cups don't work well in our jacuzzi because the floor is not smooth. It is still nice to lay on."
"OR";"I consider myself more then just a novice when in comes to the ins and outs of installing hardware and software.  But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one "
"OR";"I purchased this, as I was traveling with my 18 month old (her first trip on a plane).  She wasn't very interested.  I was pleased with it though, because it was very easy to clean up.  Now that my daughter is over 2, she is more interested in this.  We keep losing the ""water pen"" that comes with it"
"OR";"These glasses are fantastic! I read some of the reviews and was a little nervous about buying them, but I can honestly say they work great in the Florida sun! I am able to comfortably drive into the rising sun on my way to work, while everyone else has their visors down."
"OR";"Dog lover might be an understatement for my fascination with this species but this book only reinforces my tenuous claim to sanity in light of the fact that seven dogs currently live with me. The fact that we can trust these animals with our confidences and emotional turmoil much more than most of o"
"OR";"Tried this shampoo several times on my dog hoping it would work after some time and it didn't help with anything. Didn't work for itching or hot spots, not even for a day. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its claim."
"OR";"Very good looking, well-made shoe. My grandson loves his Chucks, as he calls them. He wears them to work, but he does add gel arch support soles as he's on his feet a lot."
"OR";"The online instructions and detailed steps are a big help. It went on well and cleanly, with less fuss than most. The fit is great and appears that it will protect the screen well."
"OR";"The story line was great, the characters were outstanding. But Candy please get a new edited for your books.  A lot of missed spelled words, missing words."
"OR";"Two very enjoyable movies. I have watched them at least a couple of times each. With all of the junk that's
out there on the market, it's nice to watch movies without all the filthy language and blood & guts."
"OR";"I get that they want to make it easy to get off and on, but sometimes it comes off a little too easily.  That being said, my little girl loves it very much.  It does stink that to get a new outfit, you have to buy a whole new Minnie...but it's fun for a toddler!"
"OR";"Smelled bad, very bad the first few days. Rotting grass small.

It had good support first few days. But then the support fizzled and the pillow turned into a pancake.

Not worth the price."
"OR";"Both of my German Shepards love this chew toy.  Does a great job of keeping their teeth clean and their gums healthy.  My vet comments on their choppers every time he sees them."
"OR";"I absolutely love this recording.  Mr Stewart has such a distinctive voice and carries all the characters so well.  I listened to this at least 3 times over the holidays, mostly driving to and from work and occasionally at work.  It puts me in the holiday spirit......"
"OR";"Very good dog food.  Like the healthy components of it very much because i'm careful about what I feed my dogs.  The good news is, they liked it too.  recommended for those avoiding grains."
"OR";"To my surprise this was much nicer than the true spec, much better stitching , had built in elbow pads much higher quality and half the price. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. Fit was exactly the same."
"OR";"This is a great cooler and just the right size for short trips. Coleman still makes good stuff and this is one of them. Nice product and a decent price."
"OR";"Required ten minutes of assembly.  Long wanted a grinder, don't know why I waited that long.  At this price it makes no sense at all to be filing odd parts to debur and fit."
"OR";"Perfect case for my daughters LeapPad 2. Not super thick or padded, so I don't know how much protection this provides, but she has already dropped it a couple of times with no incident."
"OR";"I absolutely adore this collection. It is Mark Twain at his most clever and fun level of prowess. If you like his novels, you must experience his short stories. Almost every one is a joy."
"OR";"Pretty good - but I had a door pinching on the cable for a bit, and it seemed to easily cut through the outer skin of the extension cord.  Nothing a little electrician's tape can't fix."
"OR";"Rick Riordian paints another masterpiece in this book.
The ending is mysterious and left me with only 1 question:
WHERE IS PERCY?!?!?! If you have never read this series,
or the prequel series, then there is serously something wrong
with you (no offense)."
"OR";"Good quality. Easy to apply n sticks really well to the wall. Tip: Clean wall with alcohol prior to apply n let it dry before applying it"
"OR";"These fit tight which I thought it was supposed to be tight. Size large. But I was told they are bad for obstacles racing. I ended up pulling my calves muscle. First time ever."
"OR";"Flimsy, thin, cheap looking and feeling, bad chemical laden smell prior to washing before I would put it anywhere near my dog. I am discarding it. Waste of money."
"OR";"Great little pot for backpacking.  The name says it all- folds and tucks away nicely.  Replaced a pot about half this size that weighed twice as much, and it's been pretty durable over the last 2 years!"
"OR";"A great ghost story which keeps you at the edge of your seat especially if you're expecting to see a ""ghost""... But it's what you don't see that will catch you off guard and still send shivers up your spine!"
"OR";"It's a good product for the money, but way too big for my bird. It's not the products fault that I couldn't imagine how big 8 inches was. But it would be great for a large bird like an Eclectus, African Gray, or even a Macaw."
"OR";"This box spring is sturdy and sits high, which I love as I am able to now use under bed storage. Takes a matter of minutes to set up with use of a screwdriver to tighten bolts."
"OR";"It works as advertised, so far (about 3 months) no problem.  I cover the screen while driving because it can be a distraction.  Once set, the camera comes on and records without any operator input, set and forget."
"OR";"a very good movie for those who like to watch the inner workings of the Reich. there is a lot of speculation as to weather the meetings actually took place or if it is just allied propaganda put together after the war. watch it and decide for your self."
"OR";"My grandson loves this stuffed dog.  It is so soft, and he sleeps with it every night. I purchased two of these so that one stays at his house, and one is available for sleepovers at our house."
"OR";"Works.  I wish I could have left my braided line in place.. it had a safety shutoff.. just in case the line broke or something and I was not around.  This one.. you have to be there to shut it off.  But it works."
"OR";"The seat cover works great and fit the backseat of our Hyundai Sante Fe just fine. The dogs love it and it is protecting our leather seat wonderfully."
"OR";"I am very happy with these remote collars. As a professional dog training I like the fact that the vibration part has several levels as well as the static. At this point Im very happy with these collars."
"OR";"Nice and bright, so far so good. They actually dim as it gets brighter in the room, so it is not just an on-and-off photo control, but a photo dimmer control. They brighten up as it gets darker, pretty cool"
"OR";"My wife and I have already made multiple batches of gummies with this product. I was afraid the dropper to fill them wasn't going to work, however I was very pleased. After letting them sit up they popped right out and were delicious!"
"OR";"Beautiful bold color. Very soft. Sized perfectly. Wish it had the matching pillow shams. Washed in COLD water ~ no problem with color running or pilling of fabric."
"OR";"As good as they get, unless you step up to the >$100 range.
Smaller than expected.
No problem attaching it to the bike
Bright enough to see by, if you  have young eyes like my daughter.
Not had it long enough to judge battery life"
"OR";"This is a very cute tool set. My son was so excited when he saw it; he especially loves the belt. It makes him feel just like Daddy and he loves to walk around the house fixing things. I definitely recommend it for any child who likes tools!"
"OR";"It was a good read but not much different than the last few. I was hoping after the first couple chapters the main characters were going to finally create new chapters in their lives."
"OR";"I own a lot of Chuvora jewelry and have never been disappointed. This ring is substantial but not heavy. Shiny. The size 9 was a perfect fit for my index finger. I really like jewelry from Chuvora."
"OR";"DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY.......NOT DURABLE AND HANDLE BREAKS WITH LITTLE FORCE.....Cheap, does not have a feature to take off metal plate. One handle broke already. Not able to tighten handle."
"OR";"I must say I have been impressed with this device. The company seems motivated to continue to improve with several firmware updates since I have had it.  Easy set up easy to use don't hesitate if you are looking to cut the cord."
"OR";"This is a heavy duty, clear shower curtain liner, which I like very much.  One can see through it as clear as looking through a window, and its heavy duty construction ensures that it will last for years and years."
"OR";"AFTER GIVING 'FREDDY' THE GRAND SON THESE LITTLE BUGS AND WATCHING HIM INTERACT WITH THEM, I THINK HE'S GENETICALLY AKIN TO THEM.
I LOVED THE GRASSHOPPER IN MY SPAGHETTI.
A 'FREDDY' GIFT."
"OR";"I love when the 'scientist' says, ""Time travel comes down this: either we are standing still and time is moving, or time is standing still, and we are moving. Either way ... .""

What? Time standing still and we are moving? Hilarious."
"OR";"I've read this entire collection,  then wanted every second book there is. Something for everyone! Great bunch of authors and great books."
"OR";"I've only worn them once but they stayed up great. I don't like no zipper but I knew that going in. I'm a size 12 woman with bigger muscular legs and I got a M."
"OR";"I love this movie.  It is very unique and timeless which I really enjoy.  It made me wish I could open a chocolate shoppe. If you love non conformity, this movie is for you."
"OR";"Three Days of the Condor and  Sneakers gave us an early preview of what we're reading in the headlines. These films would make a great double feature in the family room for adults."
"OR";"There was so much going on it was very difficult to follow.  The language by the characters was very offensive - every sentence contained a vulgar language.  Not a series I would recommend.  We stopped play about 20 minutes into the first episode."
"OR";"I bought this so my wife could feed our newborn on the couch. It's super awesome and I steal it all the time. Just don't be alarmed when it comes in the mail the first day and looks small. It'll blow up after a couple days."
"OR";"I drink a lot of cocktails and like to have the drink chilled. If you freeze the glass it has a large glass base that helps with keeping the cocktail chilled. The price is a bit high but it works."
"OR";"These are awesome headlamps. You could pay twice as much for lamps that don't give you as many options. Super comfortable on your head and not bulky or cumbersome. I definitely recommend these headlamps. Satisfaction guaranteed."
"OR";"1 of the 3 lights motion detectors only works when you are a few inches away from it.  And one of them is only as bright as a nightlight with new batteries installed.  So 2 of the 3 are defective, that's 2/3 of them."
"OR";"My daughter received a few dolls for her second birthday, and she likes this one the most.  She prefers teddy bears, and it could be it is very similar to teddy bears; more than the other dolls.  She also likes the magnetic pacifier that comes with it."
"OR";"easy to mount, spacious, light, one person can install it in 10 min, to me it fits to all cars, mine is a small honda civic and it simply fit into it"
"OR";"It really is a beautiful cutting board and my wife could not be happier.  Seems like it's well made which makes me confident it will last for years to come.  A well crafted board at a competitive price; win, win."
"OR";"Was looking forward to a GOOD period movie.  Boy oh boy...WHAT A LET DOWN.... Don't waste your money on this one.  It's story is absolute ridiculous and base,"
"OR";"Being used on our 17 year old Bengal cat. She has had to have frequent rounds of antibiotics. This probiotic is easy to administer, is apparently palatable, and gives her a real boost in terms of brightness and energy."
"OR";"I own the whole set now.... I absolutely love it and my husband and I sit and watched a couple of series on Sundays, when there does not seem to be any good tv shows... I truly recommend it"
"OR";"Well, they work! They do extend the bulb by about and inch but that was expected. I recommend using low wattage energy efficient bulbs because anytime you add an adapter to something like this there is a chance of overheating. I have not had that problem with these though."
"OR";"Well worth the $$ ....My Garmin wasn't holding a charge anymore. Figured I'd give this battery a shot. I really think this battery holds a charge longer than my original. Love it. Easy to install yourself too!"
"OR";"Good story--but too much violence...I wish the story was exaclty the same, but instead of violence, more of a battle of wits--e.g. more cloak, less dagger.  Still, a good yarn and Kingsely did a wonderful job as the ailing billionaire."
"OR";"Quality made and no leaks for me. Hand held sprayer installed by toilet in minutes and wife very happy. Thank you for making this. Amazon is awesome for allowing us easy and convenient access to these kind of stuff."
"OR";"Tac Force. Solid, fast open, sharp. Perfect size for E.D.C.. Worth twice what their asking. Just buy it. All my Tac Force knives arrive basically perfect."
"OR";"Yup, they work and they came on time. What else does one say about vacuum cleaner bags. Oh, the paper/mesh is an improvement over old bags of sizes."
"OR";"Cute indoor toy for inclement weather. Hard, smallish wheels make the trike a little difficult to move; perhaps a blessing in disguise. Folds away for easy storage."
"OR";"It is very cute, and daughter will receive this Valentine's Day.  Just be sure to check what size toy you are ordering.  I was expecting it to be bigger.  Just shows what happens when you look at too many different options - easy to get confused.  Not the product's fault though."
"OR";"Love the dress! The fit was perfect. Wore it to an engagement party got many compliments! Its also well made, i would highly recommend it."
"OR";"Great case and great quality. I've used this case for over a year now and it hasn't had any problems. The quality is wonderful and I've gotten quite a few compliments on it. It's slim, sleek and doesn't make the tablet bulky. Highly reccomend it."
"OR";"This is one of the best series I have ever read.  J. A. Jance is a writer who can catch your interest is the first couple of chapters and move you into the succeding episodes.  I'm looking forward to reading her other series in the very near future."
"OR";"Our JR loves this, and the fact it came with extra squeakers is an added plus. He usually chews things like this till they stop squeaking, go figure, when I have extra squeakers he doesn't do this."
"OR";"These splash blocks are a little lighter weight than I expected.  That being said, they are embossed like stone and a pleasing color so they are attractive as far as splash blocks go and satisfied the building inspector.  The price was right too."
"OR";"My son loves these but has to wear really thin socks because they run small.  I suggest ordering 1 size up but do get them because they have the memory foam and are very comfortable."
"OR";"holes too big, leaves fall out. Will try wetting the leaves next time and see if that helps, but in general its annoying. For context I'm using davidson's bulk tea which is great."
"OR";"Nice beginner lens filter kit. I actually the lens cap the best, now I will not loose anymore caps  Well built and Goja was a great company to buy from"
"OR";"A good action book and a reminder of what a really terrible person Pablo was.  It would be nice to have an update on what happened to many of the players in the book now."
"OR";"Story of the old west, while the main characters are gunslingers, the main character is a young girl set on revenge.  Easy enjoyable read, if you like westerns. ."
"OR";"Very handy but the only thing that's annoying is that you have to make the dog step into the arm holes or put the dog's feet into the holes.  Would be better if it attached at the belly as well"
"OR";"Husband loves this Calendar Clock.  It's very illuminating and big clear letters of numbers.  Excellent product especially for someone who can't keep up  with what day it is, both day of the week and date and time.  High recommend this product."
"OR";"I waited a long time, five years, for this installment of the Seeking Redemption. Maddie and Wyn were always in the periphery of the stories and this, their own book was fantastic. The author builds up our suspense about what tore them apart and them weaves a great reconciliation."
"OR";"It looks great, especially for tall dogs, but if the leash is very short it would be inconvenient on a short dog. Can anybody tell me how far the leash pulls out? Thank you."
"OR";"Worked perfectly first time with my iMac. Drive only got about 35MB/sec transfer rate, but that's about what you'd expect for USB 2. For under $10, I can't complain."
"OR";"This is a very interesting book of fantasy. Good stories to make one ponder their outlook and actions in life. What makes us happy, sad, or caring?"
"OR";"Thicker material that some other O'Neill board shorts.  Very comfortable, and despite being white, not ""see-through"" when they are wet.  Best pair of swimwear I have purchased in years (and I bought several other boardshorts this Summer)."
"OR";"The only shoes I can wear comfortably for the last 5 years!! They do wear quickly, but then again I do everything in them, so that may be more my fault. I get the wide size and there is room for my toes, with nothing rubbing on them."
"OR";"good movie special affects great theme show a little history about world war one glamourized by hollywood trench warfare was brutal"
"OR";"This is a VERY LARGE umbrella. The colors are bright and because of the way it is vented the wind does not easily get up under it. The button to open it works easily and it closes as expected. It would be too expensive for my budget but is clearly and excellent umbrella."
"OR";"Enjoyed this book immensely.  Count Rostov certainly exhibited ""an essential faith that by the smallest of one's actions one can restore some sense of order to the world"".  Considering his circumstances he did just that although it took decades."
"OR";"Love everything about these protectors. They are cushy enough to keep my bakeware separated but I can still stack them. I use them in all shapes of glass bakeware, also as pot and pan deviders"
"OR";"I bought a protective glove for when I use this because it is really sharp (and scary).  It worked great for slicing the fresh ginger to make candied ginger.  Love the different thickness adjustments.  Small size to store in small kitchen."
"OR";"Can't give a true feed back for this as got it for my son, but he loves loves it updated for an older version he had a long time and it never let him down"
"OR";"First off, I am a big fan of both Oliver Platt and Liam Neeson. I loved this movie lots of action and best of all you care about the characters. The surrounding cast is also terrific especially the therapy group. You'll see."
"OR";"I had one a long time ago and loved it, I was thrilled to find it again.  I even bought one for a friend for a Christmas Present.  It does pasta really well."
"OR";"I have a mix feelings about this product. It;s heavy as a shower head but, just the part that goes with the filter (the filter is heavy). The other part is ok. I like the different types of spray. The material is durable"
"OR";"I love this stuff!  I Buy it almost on a monthly basic for different various used.  I always make sure to buy the Paracord Planet brand because I know it will be great quality.  The colors are always spot on and lengths are generous."
"OR";"I did NOT buy my First Alert Carbon Monoxide Detector from Amazon, but it is a piece of junk. Mine only worked for less than a year and I paid enough that it should have worked a lot longer. Don't waste your money."
"OR";"Such a great read, all about Alexander Hamilton. Since I am not fond of our history class this book gave a lot of information to me about Alexander Hamilton. His life and events in his life that were really inspiring and extraordinary."
"OR";"Strong construction, easy to use.
Suggestion on use, make sure that when you insert the tip that you stay outside the tape.  Taper the insertion at a slight angle away from the tape."
"OR";"the board that hold the balls didn't have numbers that were easy to see, they were black and not well printed on there, i bought this same set from walmart with no problem with the board so it might of just been this one"
"OR";"Great leash, the length is great, and it has a firm hold with my dog. Just be cautious, they don't recommend using retractable leashes with choke chains and harness to stop dogs from pulling as there is constant tension on the leash."
"OR";"They did great a beautiful performance and well worth watching any time you feel like hearing a great performance by 3 young but great singers."
"OR";"I received Little Dorrit according to the subscribed timeframe and I must say in excellent condition.  Now, to find the time to be at my leisure to read all 860 pages plus Appendix I-V.  I thank you for providing this opportunity!"
"OR";"Absolutely horrible. I honestly don't think the other reviews are real. The connectors don't work. At all. I just opened the box, tried to install, and every strip has an issue.  Don't waste your money."
"OR";"Great story... William Hurt is amazing, and it's def. a movie every doctor should watch. I love movies where the character is forced to re-examine their beliefs."
"OR";"You need to have your helper us a target, just reading the stick isn't possible from much distance since there isn't any magnification thru this sight level. It's an inexpensive way to do landscaping work."
"OR";"I don't have a problem with the product itself but it is packaged in a flimsy, unsealed, cardboard box and the small carbon flecks leak out of the packaging.  This ruined some of the other items that were shipped with it in an earlier order, so now I am very careful what other items I purchase at th"
"OR";"we originally bought for food and water BUT the water kept seeping passed the hole at the edge for lift the chrome bowl out to clean or refill...though the quality seemed to be there, we will be donating these items."
"OR";"For my work jeans it's a perfect belt. It holds up while leather/plastic belts twist, stretch out, stain with sweat. This holds up and looks good month after month of hard use."
"OR";"I love this tool for a quick way to put some juliene carrots, jicama and zuchinni in my salads. When this blade gets too dull to do the job, I will most certainly buy another."
"OR";"This is perfect for what I needed!!!  Love the ability of this little speaker!  I can use USB to play my music, FM Radio or Bluetooth.  I haven't found a speaker that is able to do so much."
"OR";"Our 4 year old grandson loved the detail and the fact that the back door opens on this mail truck.  It's sturdy too and can take rough handling.  We received this quickly."
"OR";"There is a reason it is so inexpensive. It emits a loud buzz when a USB device is plugged into it. And it is so wide that it would be dangerous to install in a metal box or in any box with another device. Spend a few more bucks on a better product."
"OR";"PART 2 PICKED RIGHT UP WHERE PART ONE ENDED.  ALL I WILL SAY IS THESE GIRLS WILL GO ALL OUT FOR THEIR DAD EXCEPT ONE & I WANTED TO KICK HER BUTT.  GREAT JOB PART 3 SHOULD BE HOT BECAUSE DADDY'S HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"OR";"Fit well. Good material. My son's measurements are 5'4"" tall. 135-140lbs. I ordered him a large and they come to the lower part of his knees sitting just below his belly button. Hope someone finds this information helpful."
"OR";"Put one each on the rod holder well on both sides of hull and now the deck has a nice glow. These are rigid, they have flexible ones that are more like a tape, these are about 1/2"" thick and more visible."
"OR";"recommended by my trainer. Great for an easy workout. I also use it as a desk chair and I believe that is improving my balance.
Blowing it up with the included air pump is quite a workout as well."
"OR";"Three stars because they're nice looking shoes; two lost because they are terribly uncomfortable.

The foot bed is too long, the heel is too wide, yet the crossing straps are too tight. I am in the process of returning them."
"OR";"Loved every part of this book about to start the next book now you mist read this book speshly if you love dragon story's"
"OR";"This keyboard is very nice. It is sleek, heavy, and durable. I won't go on and on about it, since it is just a keyboard, but I will say that it is very fun to type on.
Make sure you know where the symbols are before switching to this keyboard. No writing takes a bit of getting used to."
"OR";"I like it. Fits my 4' 10"" tween very well. Long gloves do not stay up on her forearms, but ok, not a major issue.  She's happy = I'm happy."
"OR";"This cable works exactly as expected. There is no signal delay, and no degradation of picture quality, even though it is really long.
Its hard to get excited about a cable, so I can't really say I LOVE it. But I would definitely recommend it."
"OR";"A little tricky to fill with air without letting a bunch out while trying to get the plug in. But fun!
Also, I don't know why it came out of box with a sticky/greasy residue all over it."
"OR";"Brilliant Book...If you enjoyed Pillars of the Earth, you will enjoy this one too.......I've  just discovered this author and I really enjoy the insight he gives into the life of the peasant in those days and how all levels of society interact with one another....."
"OR";"Beautiful Invicta watch.  Has gold plated sections which add class.  Great construction and comes in unique ""Water proof"" yellow box.  Sure to get noticed."
"OR";"I can stuff several dolls and a handful of accessories in here. It's been great for trips and other times when our daughter wanted to take her dolls with her. The chain handle broke, but the box has held up decently."
"OR";"I love to shoot in low light with no flash.
This film is perfect for that. I've pushed it to one stop with great results.
Great contrast and tones."
"OR";"Surprisingly the shoes felt a little short, though I got a half size larger only after a few more wears with a knee high the shoes stretched a bit and are now perfect!"
"OR";"Great product, I use everyday on 4 dogs to help in addition to brushing their teeth to remove plaque build up and keep their breath smelling fresh."
"OR";"works fine, i was cautious to get this one over the kline, but i'm happy i did, i scooped the replacements (Greenlee 9953-11 Replacement Blade for Conduit Reaming Screwdriver 9753-11C) as well, but haven't had to change em yet"
"OR";"It's always a long wait for a new Gabriel Allon book by Daniel Silva. This book, like the others, was worth the wait. It was especially nice to have so many references to past characters & books, and kind of tying them together."
"OR";"This is one of the most awesome body stockings I have ever owned.  It is comfortable enough to wear under a dress and looks awesome.  Buy two...you are going to want to have a spare"
"OR";"as always Sinbad is hilarious he tends to show you many of the things that we have lived through or are currently going through and how funny they really are I enjoy comedy because it gives me a chance to get out of the hectic part of life just for brief moment"
"OR";"Always wanted the Red Shrimp and where to get them is from Obsession all 5 made the trip love to live in my live plants, and are in with my Ghost Shrimp and with my Mirco Mexican crayfish ,now I find myself watching for hours"
"OR";"Bought this and installed it myself....a breeze;  Both my wife & I love this grinder. I believe it would grind up bones as well..
but I won't even try! Have had it almost 20 years now!"
"OR";"Fabulous read. Roberts never disappoints and this book is no exception. Fast paced with lots persists and turns. I read this book in two days."
"OR";"Bought two more of the Stamina 1300 exercise bikes for aging family members.  Great, easy to use, bike that has features you can explain even to those that are not computer literate.  If you want a fancy bike, this isn't it."
"OR";"Bought in december 2015 and its already not working. Purchased for my son to ise on his xbox 1. Worked fine for about a year and now the xbox just doesnt detect it anymore. Tons of games on it that he cant access anymore."
"OR";"i love my big neon green hat and so did my grand baby fits to a tee can be worn by husband too he has a big head or pull drawstring to fit my head which is small"
"OR";"After seeing several interviews Luttrell gave, this book explains why he seems so hyper.  He lived through the hell of war and saw his teammates killed.  Not sure I would enjoy the movie after reading the graphic description of what happened."
"OR";"My son loves this.....although he doesn't sit on it right, lol. I purchased it based on child hood memories of my own, and soon enough he'll figure out how to ""sit n spin""."
"OR";"This strap worked just fine while I was on a river ride in Costa Rica. It also strapped right onto the helmet I used for the zip-line course. It allowed me to get some great footage of my friends while on vacation. Highly recommend."
"OR";"Quality stainless steel scissor with excellent cutting abilities. Have been using it for cardboard as well as multiple sheets of paper and it is great. The handle does start to feel uncomfortable after a while otherwise I would have given it five stars."
"OR";"I bought this to cook brown rice...It takes a LONG time to cook! It also takes up a LOT of space on my counter.  Not sure I'll use it all that much for fact."
"OR";"i don't know what they were thinking when they edited this soap opera. they shopped it up in a way that interferes with the story and the sequence of events. things happen sometimes, and you find out later why they happen in terms of the story line."
"OR";"The color is much darker in person. The material is nice and soft, but I wanted something a little lighter yellow to match my room. It's much more of a mustard color"
"OR";"I use this keyboard to manage servers for the company I work for. Its very compact and the capability to get both mouse and keyboard over a single USB is amazing! 5 stars to the seller and manufacturer for this great protective case."
"OR";"You have to have some dainty little teacups for these things to hold more than 2. The quality is very poor; each hook is a slightly different shape and size than the others. Very unstable on the shelf, too. Waste of money."
"OR";"Six pack turned into a five pack but it was just as well. They were way too big. The size does not coincide with your normal pants size. Lesson learned. Check for size chart and take some measurements."
"OR";"This 3rd film in the Hobbit saga is again a bit long and too full of action to bring emotions to the table as some scenes seem more like a video game and Peter Jackson seems to be playing more than making a movie."
"OR";"I thought this would be a good action film, it was a good B rated action film that you could sleep through.  The first 20 min, there was more violence than I care to see....too much blood and gore."
"OR";"This particular wrap is light-infused magic, but all Thai silk scarves/throws/wraps make a wonderful addition to any wardrobe, and this one, like the others I've bought, turned something blah into something beautiful."
"OR";"I'm not usually a serial reader because I have issues with patience meaning I can't wait to read the next installment! This serial caught me right away and I love the characters!"
"OR";"This author keeps me coming back; I want to make time in my day to read.  She hooked me with the first book and I just can't wait for her next release."
"OR";"I bought this for my 125 pound dog and he loves it. I don't put a treat in it cause the ones I used just fell out. My big guy just chews on this all day."
"OR";"Definitely not commercial grade, but it worked fine for my house. I've used a small variety of keystone jacks, and they have all worked.

If one side of the jack is not all the way in before putting the other side in, it can get wedged, which is a minor pain."
"OR";"Doesn't slide around. Doesn't interfere with the door closing. Works great. Use it in the bathroom to hang towels. Wish they were available in a non-monochrome color."
"OR";"You will read that the Hopper can take an external drive with a max of 3 terabytes, but this 3 terabyte drive works perfectly. It was truly plug and play.  I highly recommend it!"
"OR";"There is nothing to say really, just look at the photos. The more one knows about Leibovitz's life and career, the more depth the photos take on. I bought this book for a present and I had so much trouble parting with it I bought a second one for myself. She is a master. Period."
"OR";"Light always stays on, wired it every which way possible.  Not sure if its supposed to, but I needed a 240volt switch to control a compressor located in a back room and wanted the light to only be on when the switch is on."
"OR";"This product is not safe for dogs.  It gives off sharp shards and is hard as a rock.  My dogs back teeth are ruined.  Not worth the risk ... find another safer chew."
"OR";"I bought 2 sets of these ramekins.  I haven't used them yet.  They are really nice.  I just wish they were 6 ounces, it seems they are a little small.  I think these should come in a set of 4 so they are not quite as expensive as buying them 2 at a time."
"OR";"They are very nice crisp clear speakers with a thunderous bass.  Definately a nice punch for the dolllars. I hear great things about this brand,(Boston Acoustics)but it was even more wonderful once I experienced the sound for myself.  Definately a lovely addition."
"OR";"Got this to replace a little cheap video card that did not support my four computer monitors well. This video card is GREAT and my computer does not lag as it did before with the cheap alternative. This is still low-end but it's great quality for the buck!"
"OR";"These are amazing gloves!! The sizing was a bit confusing, but I read through comments to figure it out. They are extremely soft, flexible and feel like they were made for my hands! They are sleek and low profile, not bulky what so ever. So extremely happy with them!"
"OR";"I have tried the harness type car restraint but my dog was miserable. This is just an anchored leash. All I need to keep her out of the front seat but still let her get her head up front."
"OR";"Great quality, works well for outdoor photography, plenty of pocket to keep items handy.m very well made and surprisingly comfortable"
"OR";"Bought these for my girlfriend after several fails from jet. com trying to send me the right size and they were great aside the fact that u gotta break em in."
"OR";"This is the most handy item I have ever used in the shower. It is sturdy and holds all my bottles of shampoo and conditioner with ease. It is out of the way and looks like it was built into the shower. I love it."
"OR";"I used these to replace the busted turning lights for the car. They are a lot brighter than the stock lights.

During the daytime, you can definitely see the rear turning lights on despite the bright white."
"OR";"Fits my exo terra perfectly. Looks nice. Just wish it had a two button switch so I could have two differant bulbs.
I think I may order another and put the night bulbs in that one. Not sure yet."
"OR";"Amazon basics is the next best thing to apple products. And it even beats apple in price. I would highly recommend this as a reliable alternative or extra cable."
"OR";"This cable arrived DOA. It doesn't appear damaged in any way, but it definitely doesn't work. I tested it on four different computers and two different monitors, and the monitors never got a signal."
"OR";"This movie was great.  It explained what the Arab people want to do to Christians and Jews.  They are also teaching their children to kill at a very young age.  These people have no love just hate. Islam is a terrible religion that keeps the women in bondage."
"OR";"I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  "
"OR";"I wasn't really expecting much from this water bottle but I really ended up liking it.  Works great for the dogs and two can even drink from it at the same time."
"OR";"My daughter received a smaller version of this in her Citrus Lane box and she absolutely loves it!  When I first saw it I thought it was just another cheap plastic toy that I'm gonna have to keep up with the pieces.  She played with it all day yesterday."
"OR";"This is the only brand of ankle high's that don't fit too snug around the ankle. I just love them . I've used them since my last trip to the USA about three years ago !!"
"OR";"First time using this brand, it works beuatifully, initailly used it full length 50 feet and no issue, will be using it in different lengths soon."
"OR";"This is about half the size of what I expected. From top to bottom it will hang maybe half way down in your closet. To give you an idea of the size each pocket area holds about a half dozen sock pairs."
"OR";"This worked it syncs with my phone but short of it ringing when my phone rings that all it was good for. It did not sync with my calendar and when someone calls their name dose not come up on their phone number. So I gave to my 6 year old to play with."
"OR";"Very light weight and extremely comfortable.  They are great with traveling easy off/on getting through airport security.  Packing friendly because they can be stuffed in the smallest corner of luggage space."
"OR";"Simply put, these are blazing fasts drives at an excellent price point! Much faster than the basic Kingston SSDNow 240GB, nice for an OS with a few of your favorite games!"
"OR";"It's a very well constructed box, holds plenty of cards, is just the right size.  And it looks cool.  I got it for my husband and his Magic friends were jealous and his next game they had similar boxes from this manufacturer to hold their cards."
"OR";"Very nice replacements to my iPod ear buds.  Sound quality is at least as good and the cord is longer.  Alos the angled minijack helps keep the ear phones from becoming unpluged easily."
"OR";"Amazing knife. This is the smoothest opening knife I have ever used. Handle and blade design is perfect. Great all around carry knife or hunting knife. This knife should sell for much more than it does."
"OR";"This is so fun--such cute pieces and fun ideas for headbands.  My daughter and I have had fun working together on these (although we used my hot glue gun instead of the glue that came with it)"
"OR";"These logs maybe last about an hour. As soon as you light them up they start breaking down and falling apart. I bought them from Home Depot for $20 which was a complete waste of money. Any other brand will be better, trust me!"
"OR";"Just got my bread pans today and really like the way they are constructed.  Can't wait to make paleo bread in them because I can pull the sides of the pan out to see if the bread set up before baking it."
"OR";"This toy would benefit greatly from an on/off switch.  My 9 mo old seems mildly entertained by it, but you can't turn it off, you can't put it away. I think I'm going to have to get rid of it."
"OR";"One of the most challenging books on marriage out there today.  The main caption says it all.  ""What if God designed marriage not to make you happy, but to make you holy?""  Some will turn away in disgust, but others will have their marriages revolutionized."
"OR";"These are great!  The only reason I took off one star is the designs look like they'll wear off easily and I wish there were more mature designs for older kids."
"OR";"Great story about the Polish underground and the little told story of their effort to rescue victims of the Natzi reign of terror and death.  The role of the depleted Warsaw zoo is fascinating."
"OR";"Tom Hardy so muscular and built up, including a mask hiding his face, you won't recognize him.  But, his acting was, as always, great.  This one, some good actors, production.  If you like the Batman series, you'll like it."
"OR";"This was better than I expected.  Well acted and directed!  Sinister is definitely a good name for this one!  I was not 'thrilled' with the ending.....but that is better than the usual 'lived happily ever after'."
"OR";"Cap was difficult to turn after a short while. Also takes some time to shake and wait for the treats to fall into the small hole to fill it. Otherwise a good toy. I like the adjustable slider to keep treats from pouring out."
"OR";"Love Carhartt Big & Tall. Always fits me perfectly even though I'm very broad in the shoulders, which for other clothes tends to make the sleeves too short."
"OR";"This series just draws you in and holds onto you until you are finished reading the entire book! I can't wait for Part 5 to see how the story ends, if that's the end!"
"OR";"I read other reviews but bought this anyway. And I am not sorry. I have a smaller tub/shower so the words can be a little hard to read, But everyone I showed it to had no problem reading it and knowing what it was."
"OR";"It was fast paced and kept me very interested in finding out what would happen to Peeta and Katniss.  I liked it the most because the story line was unique and like nothing I had ever read."
"OR";"Love kits like this that allow the children (or adult) to have the freedom to build different things with the same bricks. I bought it for a nephew for christmas and he still plays with it. He is particularly fond of the helicopter but I have seen him build the airplane too."
"OR";"Fascinating story of one of England's most disruptive social policies. Well acted and the story is almost unbelievable, but it is true!  Finally, after 50 years, the government issued an apology.  If history is of interest to you, this movie is a must!"
"OR";"This lasted about 1 month and then started to come apart from regular use around my arm at the gym.  I had to sew it back together but it has been a frustrating purchase.

I used it with the IPOD classic pictured in the icon."
"OR";"I have a ragdoll and this is perfect, the bristles are not stiff but are gentle on her skin and the pins pick up any loose hair and snag any knots. She really enjoys being brushed and it's small enough to get into tight spots."
"OR";"I'm in my 70s, so bike shorts are not becoming. Neither are these but they are otherwise wonderful to wear for bike rides. I ordered 2 pairs. And the ""comfort crotch"" is good for the sit bones. I would purchase them again."
"OR";"I should start off by saing that my speakers are pretty big and they are hanging at a odd angle.  The mounts did get the job done, but not too sure on if the weight rating is as good as they say.  I think they are one of the best choices in the price range."
"OR";"I really love my new mug. I'm using it every day. It was a little treat for myself at holiday time. It's beautiful and perfect for taking with me in the car."
"OR";"When I got around to wearing them, they fit, but the shoe laces were different colors and had different lengths. The left shoe lace was so short it would not form a proper bow and would not stay tied."
"OR";"I think these headphones are a pretty good deal, considering the low cost.  The blue LED doesn't really bother me at all and I think that having a volume control built into the cord is a great feature.  I'm very satisfied with them."
"OR";"Review for Brown: Descent quality leather for sure, nice buckle, but rather narrow width and extremely shorter for standard length make this brand-named belt ashamed."
"OR";"This is a nice little pump. I though it was somehow smaller, but it is very lightweight, has handy plastic + velcro mount that you install under the water bottle screws. I've used it a couple of times, but not yet for inflating a new tube."
"OR";"My 5 and 2 year old grandsons love this game. It is something different from other games that have either a path or playing cards. The only problem is the spinner. When the boys hold it, the arrow catches on a finger."
"OR";"Other reviews stated problems with theses bulbs. I installed two of them one lasted about 12 hours so who knows on the others. I will not buy anymore and would not suggest them to others."
"OR";"We just redid our closets, so I wanted to be 'SUPER"" organized. And these ""Dream Drawer Organizer"" fit the bill. Easy to use/install since they're spring-loaded. Just make sure you are aware of the ""length"" and ""height"" that you need."
"OR";"A precious story told by a ten year old girl and her fun summer she had before going to middle school. It was a sweet and fun tale. I really enjoyed it."
"OR";"I bought this title to add to my 'Grandma Library.'  I have several Amber Brown books.  One of my granddaughters is in the third grade and really enjoys reading the independent and confident spirt of the title character!"
"OR";"Great continuation! I like the way the author does not waste time/pages reiterating things that happened in the previous books. I've found a new author to follow."
"OR";"This is my first Tana French book and would be willing to try another. At first, I thought that the plot was too far-fetched but then the characters developed and could see that something like this might happen. Some nice details in both characters and setting."
"OR";"came in on time, nice size cleans up very well, doesn't slide around on the tile floor, works great for our small dogs"
"OR";"The package of Penguin Classics, whose books I find really excellent in content and presentation, is not so good. They do not have any hard protection and the corners always  arrive somewhat damaged."
"OR";"I've been looking for leather lifting straps and saw these. While I can't offer a comparison to other types of straps, these are terrific for those days you want to go heavy on deadz but your grip won't let you."
"OR";"Besides the intriguing storyline that I expected, I learned a little more about falcontry, windmills and life in Wyoming. Went thru Cheyenne once 50 years ago and stayed at ""Little America""."
"OR";"OK.  There are multiple, varying reviews on these boots.  Some people say that they are a little big, some say they're ridiculously big... IF YOU OWN ANY OTHER TIMBERLAND SHOES OR BOOTS, JUST ORDER ONE FULL SIZE SMALLER THAN THOSE.

The confusion is that Timberlands (in every other case) run big and"
"OR";"I thought they would be made out of wood like they used to be.  I was sad to see they are made from some kind of rubber.  They're still very nice and comfortable.  The latch on mine is functional, not Velcro, as others have stated here, and I'm happy about that."
"OR";"This Book Is So So Good. This is a Must Must Read. It got every thing you want in a book. I give this book A Plus 5 rating"
"OR";"Nice well-made frame. It's nothing special, but was what I needed. It looks sleek and nice with a colorful print in it. It's not high end wood, but still nice and glass not plastic."
"OR";"Nice looking and not too hard to construct...but made out of very FLIMSY particleboard and CHEAP inferior material... the veneer was soooo thin that it is almost not there... there were many chinks and damaged surfaces in the top piece and the whole thing is just not good quality."
"OR";"the only problem i had with this speakers is the battery, when playing without plugin the charger the volume will become less loud
, than when the charger is plugged in, other than that the sounds is really good loud and clear but lack bass...."
"OR";"This got out a stain that had been on a chair for months. I didn't want to ruin the chair and had no idea what to use when I came across this, so I thought I would give it a try. Worked wonders and smelled great as well. Finally something that works"
"OR";"These hold downs work  o.k.  the rods are soft and bend easily, which prevents the hold down from flatly pushing on the work.  I still use them but clamping cawls are essential."
"OR";"So easy to put together!  It's sturdy and it is high enough that it leaves plenty of storage spece below the bed.  I highly recommend this base to go with a memory foam mattress."
"OR";"The pieces were so small my min-pin swallowed them whole...That is why I gave them  a 3. I gave them to a friend who has a tea cup poodle, and she really likes them so they also need a 5 from her.."
"OR";"This product is a lot smaller then I anticipated it to be. However. It works wonderfully for the most part.  Some cons:
Magnifier seems cloudy
I wish it had a table clamp rather then solid base"
"OR";"My kids love all the Monopolies, especially this one. Just wish that the pictures on the properties shown on the board were also pictured on the property cards like with the Marvel Comics Edition."
"OR";"Highlights: Terrifying scenes of suspense and building of tension; immaculate cinematography depicting lifeless England; most of the performances, principally lead Cillian Murphy's and the reliable Brendan Gleeson's; alternative ending is KILLER.
Lowpoints: Too much zombies, too little subliminal te"
"OR";"I saw this at Sur La Table for $25.00 over the weekend and fell in love.  Amazon has the best prices for the exact same item.  Works well and so much fun."
"OR";"The product arrived quickly and the quality was excellent. I had the subject on hard back, but listening to the subject on CD impacted the delivery and allowed others to join in and listen. Looking for other products like it."
"OR";"Easy to install, look great, we'll made, love the super long pull setting and a great addition to my Salsa Fargo."
"OR";"I use it to clean my tankless water heater and it's fine. It's important to make sure the free hose is well secured in the bucket or it can spray loose and make a mess."
"OR";"Like the original Stargate Series, this doesn't let the Stargate aficionado down. The same thrill and excitement exist as well as a certain chemistry that has come to be expected in all shows associated with the original Stragate."
"OR";"These are some of my go-to toys for foster animals; especially during the winter months. It gives them something to do to work their minds while they are stuck indoors. These ones have held up good and my heavy chewers haven't shredded them into a million pieces."
"OR";"I bought this to replace my 500w Halogen floodlight. This defiantly did the trick.  This 30w is just enough light for what I needed, but it wasn't so overly bright that it disturbed our neighbors.  This will not be my last LED flood light."
"OR";"Love this movies, great detail, wonderful special effects, great acting well worth watching! Great sequel showing how it all began!"
"OR";"It did a pretty good job on my tile and hardwood floors.  Very easy to changes the brushes and fill and empty water containers. It was a little heavier than I thought it would be though."
"OR";"I totally enjoyed this touching story.  The lives of these strong resilient women  should never be forgotten!  A sad story, but the strength of family is shown as being uppermost in their lives, and I believe that is what helped them endure."
"OR";"Super cute on but wore one time & already material is beading up. Feels like wash & trash clothes. Not happy because shirt is really cute."
"OR";"First half seemed to go slowly jumping back and forth between the two main characters. It then picked up and I found it very enjoyable and was surprised by ending. Entirely different then expected."
"OR";"So someone told me about this---and I wanted to get a quality dog food without a lot of corn or fillers and this product gets eaten by my precious pekes."
"OR";"So many facts of a time in the UK if done differently could have lost the war and of the man  who saw it so clearly and was right. Well worth the time to read."
"OR";"This thing is plastic so don't step on it!  But it does the job so well!  I had to push the magnets down in their little slots so it would stick to the metal register and it works great!"
"OR";"My sons favorite item this Christmas. Great product holds so many of his figures

. Only negative is that for a three year old it's a bit difficult to open"
"OR";"My puppy loves the dirt under the grass and how soft it is when she has to go! I love looking at the green grass and how fresh it is. A little water keeps it very fresh. Excellent purchase."
"OR";"The cable works perfectly in the feed for our cable internet, delivering over 60 MB/sec.  Good selection of lengths, so I was able to get exactly what I needed, without having a bunch left over to clutter up the installation."
"OR";"A upbeat quicky of a book. It may be short but it's steamy Hott.
Laura Hobbs lost her job as an accountant. When she comes across a ad for a submissive assistant. Her curiosity peaks. What would it be like?"
"OR";"Bought as a gift  for my daughter in law for Christmas. I bought her the nativity set last Christmas and plan on adding to it each year for her. The quality of the pieces is very nice!"
"OR";"Nice big sturdy Laundry Bag hope the two handles stay on and don't fall off or I'll have to request a return for a fefund or free new Laundry Bag"
"OR";"Purchased for my 7 month old German Shepherd so she could ride comfortably in the car and look out the window. She does great and loves her new seat belt."
"OR";"they are already gone - have 2 lop-eared bunnies who love this product.  Kaytee is a good brand to begin with and these cubes are no exception.  They are not too difficult to separate.  My bunnies approve of this product!"
"OR";"HALO is a major franchise, a known world populated with a diverse group of races.
Mega Bloks is doing HALO right providing an excellent selection of races and their vehicles in well thought out kits.
The 2014 line is no exception and this is one of the better items released this year.

The Mega Blok"
"OR";"My grandchild loves horses and Dr. Suess books. This is a hit with both and poor Robert's dilemma. Snuggle with a child you love and enjoy this fun book!"
"OR";"Julian Barnes has a real winner. Literally it won the Booker Man prize but also, it is deserving of it! We read this for our book club and it was perfect for discussion. Highly recommend."
"OR";"I needed a way to hook up my external sata dock to one of my computers and it killed me using 2.0 USB port over eSata. This dropped right into my system and solved my problem."
"OR";"This top is adorable! Very flattering and I love the black with white flowers. The only problem is when I bend over. It's a little too revealing in the chest area when I have to bend over to pick things up. I'll just have to wear something under it."
"OR";"I'm wearing now. I have a lot of different color and style underwear and tidy whites fit right in. My girlfriend says it reminds her of her 1st  real boyfriend and I'm 70."
"OR";"After 4 months!  Sometimes I go several days without using it. When I do use it, it may be for only 5 minutes or up to 90 minutes.  But, its got enough hours on it that I was VERY impressed at the battery life.  I use it 100% for podcasts.  Usually it sits in the cup holder of my truck to listen to "
"OR";"This water bottle is easy to fill up and clean, and I don't have to worry about it leaking.  The stainless cap and base give it a solid feel and a sleek look.  I highly recommend it."
"OR";"Love it. Got it for the Note 10.1 2014. Love the many angles to adjust the screen. All ports and buttons are available while in the case. High quality and secure."
"OR";"I absolutely love this ring! I haven't taken it off since I got it (a few days ago) and it seems to be holding up well. I may buy another one."
"OR";"this product is okay I guess. My dog really have a bad breath, saw online the reviews pretty good try it for a month only, well I can say is his breath improves just a little it's because I can still smell his bad breath."
"OR";"This is a very low napped rug. I thought it was gray and white but it looks more like gray and cream. I have it in a high traffic area and its easy to keep clean. Im very happy with this."
"OR";"My two month old chihuahua puppy really likes the blue and the gray bone, the other one has no appeal to her, no smell or roughness... it's worth it for the first two bones!"
"OR";"i need another, send me more :) they work soooooo good! i want a backup pair because i abuse these things a LITTLE :) no problems or complains tho i love them"
"OR";"This was my third attempt to try and find a split leash for my two mini Aussies. It's light and very comfortable. It doesn't drag on the ground and the handle is cushioned which I wasn't expecting. Will buy from this retailer again when the need comes!"
"OR";"Works good.  I would clean it as soon as you get finished juicing.  I would also run the pulp through it an additional time to get all the juice out of it."
"OR";"Great for Marvel Universe 3-3/4"" figures.  Clear plastic gives the illusion that they're standing on their own.  Only complaint is for the price and for plastic they should give you twice as much!"
"OR";"Although the jacket was the correct size, sleeves a little long but will be tailored. The pants were way too big but again nothing a tailor cannot fix. For the price, excellent buy!"
"OR";"My cat loves this toy. She'll run all the way from one end of the room then take a swing at the ball then sprint to the other side of the room. She love it."
"OR";"This is really cute on my chi. She's ten pounds and kind of chubby. It seems to be thick and of good quality, and since our chi is a princess, pink is perfect."
"OR";"i have had this clock for a while and it drive me nuts. i have had to fix the time over and over i don't know if its normal but i took the batteries out and not bother using it. i need clock for my kitchen but i can find a different one ."
"OR";"Overall the pan is a great value.  I use it mostly for frying foods.  The only drawback is that the finish on the frying surface grew dull after the first use and no matter what I do it stays dull and marbled looking."
"OR";"Oh my god my cats love this crackle chute so much!  One of the best made ones I've ever purchased and plenty of crinkle!"
"OR";"I like these underwear. They came in a variety of colors. I like the fabric, it is smooth and it stays in place. The only thing that I don't like is that the lining that goes in the private part is white; I just wished the lining was of the same color of the rest of the bikini."
"OR";"We have two of these. The large would be too big for our dogs. Our dogs range from 14-26 lbs. Good toy, easy for humans to see, less of a trip hazard for bipeds. Nonadjustable, but large kibble would work fine."
"OR";"They fit as expected, well ventilated for summer walks/runs, and I don't get blisters while wearing them. I have a hard step and I'm very active...have tried several different ""top-of-the-line"" well known brands, and have now settled on these as my go-to."
"OR";"Love, love, love, my bentgo lunch boxes.  I bought several to give as gifts to my grandchildren, they all use them all the time. Awesome buy."
"OR";"Was too heavy for the cheap set I bought (and returned) and currently are not using it; afraid it will put stress on the lines inside the wall and will end up with a mess I don't know about till it's too late but does work as expected; kind of expensive"
"OR";"I have washed them out and reused them. How nice. I'm doing a lot of wood and wall sanding, they go from one to the other great but occasionally I hit paint and these cleaned up nicely with warm soap and water just make sure you give them time to dry"
"OR";"Adriana Trigiani gives readers a beautiful tale in this novel. She writes of friendship, family love and strength, and romance.  Ms. Trigiani's words are weaved into an epic story."
"OR";"You could say the holiday spirit is all around. Dec the Holls was a fast read, but very loving. Two lonely people fine what they are looking for when they are not looking"
"OR";"Purchase this book and try what it tells you to do. You will get results. If you do not do what it tells you do do...you will still learn a lot by asking yourself by why you aren't acting. It's worth it any way you slice it."
"OR";"Looks beautiful reddish brown, required assembly but wasn't too challenging. The opening is a good height for our cat, but we're leaving the door open the first few days to let him adjust."
"OR";"Rocked: Joe and Liss are very close to the top of my fav books list. I was not sure I would like this one as much. turned out I did! I loved it! lol."
"OR";"What I wanted. Yes vacuum out the little plastic clamps and secure to your wall or floor. It works, it is secure. It's a small safe to keep prying eyes out, but big enough to hold quite a bit. Exactly what I wanted."
"OR";"We love this movie better than the original Wizard of Oz, not that the original was bad. Just we love this rebooted version more.

It is a dip into sci-fi and fantasy, a bit darker direction as well. But it was great!

I am certain most younger generation will love this movie."
"OR";"This mouse is helping me write this review as I speak. Works great.  The scroll button is the opposite of a normal  windows computer though. That always screws me up. But overall its flawless and works several  months on a set of batteries."
"OR";"These bulbs give out just the right amount of lumens for my usage - on top of a book case where I place the Crucifix and other religious items - not too bright, not too dim. I highly recommend."
"OR";"My puppy loves batting it around to hear the sounds. Older dog, not so much. It does pick up vibration of walking when on the hardwood floors and will make animal sounds when you walk close."
"OR";"I bought this for my 18 month old Granddaughter. She loves Abby and she loves that this Abby talks and sings. She carries it whenever we go out and enjoys hugging her. She really does giggle when she hears Abby talk and sing."
"OR";"Great story. I was actually caught off guard by the ending and I usually know who did it pretty quickly. Great for someone who likes an easy read"
"OR";"Needed a new wrench as someone had made off with my old one. Does what I need it to do, which is open bungs. I usually use it to open bungs on 55-gallon steel drums, but I have been known to open a bung or two on plastic drums."
"OR";"I was looking for a green tie in a certain shade of green and I found it with this tie. Great color! I love the vintage look and feel of this tie. Arrived on time and was packaged well. Overall happy customer here!"
"OR";"I chuckled throughout the book....love the cynicism and sarcasm.  Interesting ending I wouldn't have guessed.  Gave me a feel for what the war in Afghanistan must be like.  Very appropriate for our times, unfortunately."
"OR";"Got these for my nice who wanted ""fake nose rings"" they work and look real when on. a bit big for a nose ring, works better as a lip ring."
"OR";"This is an extremely nice camp chair. It sets up in under a minute and is very strong given its' size and weight. (If you're interested in learning more check out my outdoor gear review blog http://gearandwear. weebly."
"OR";"Hard to find smaller food quality glasses. This my second set.  I mixed them with the fleur de lis design.  Perfect size cocktail glass."
"OR";"Interesting series that was cancelled before its time.  Would have liked to see it developed more, but the short ride was worth it.  It would be great to see Peter Weller in more scifi."
"OR";"I WAS THRILLED WITH THE BOOK AND IT MADE A GOOD ENDING TO THIS SERIES AND I AM THRILLED THAT THERE IS ANOTHER 3 BOOK SERIES COMING OUT THAT WILL CONTINUE THE STORY. THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DEVELOPED AND THE PACE IS GOOD.  THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DEFINED AND THE WHOLE SERIES WAS VERY ENJOYABLE."
"OR";"This item has one function, and doesn't hold up to that function. The sides of the ball don't close tight enough to prevent little particles of tea getting into your water. Don't buy it, get something else."
"OR";"Awesome! This is the third book in the Take a Chance series and I couldn't put it down! At the same time, I never wanted it to end because I was not ready to say good-bye to two such wonderful characters. I sure hope there are more books coming about the Chance family!"
"OR";"An awesome collection of stories.  Read the Kindle version and I was not impressed with all the typos in it.  Amazon or the books publisher need to do a better job in editing the e-reader versions."
"OR";"This is the first tower that my sister's cats have seen. I actually gave it to my BIL as part of his birthday. They have had to rearrange some of the shelves to try to preserve the toys but this has only made the cats more excited"
"OR";"These pedals grab your feet and just hang on. Recently moved into town, and I get tired of unclipping at stop signs. These are a great alternative if you want less bother and wish to wear 'normal' shoes."
"OR";"Ava is continually giving back the bracelet.  She jumps to conclusions and can't even confront the man she supposedly loves.  She is a winer and it hard to read what an immature woman she is!  Nico should be fed up and sick of her!"
"OR";"I love this film and rented it from Netflix on a few occasions.  Would LOVE to purchase the DVD from Amazon, but with a $150.00 - $200.00 price tag, FORGET IT!  This is a film screaming for a remastered Blu-Ray release...at a reasonable price."
"OR";"Reading the last of the trilogy now and have enjoyed it very much. I probably enjoyed it because I am very familiar with the area that she wrote about. I had relatives who lived in all the areas she wrote about and had visited that area many times."
"OR";"This is a nicely made and attractive item in which to store your pet's ashes. It is better and much less expensive than anything offered by the pet cemetery. Still miss my little guy, though."
"OR";"Interesting take but refreshing too.  I like all the different races mesh but then look at ""real"" life.  Somehow we all get along, sure we have our differences whether it's politically incorrect or infused"
"OR";"It is a bit more light weight than I thought it would be, all in all, it is a very sturdy tripod. Although, there was an excess amount of lubricant on it when it first came. I use this with my canon T3i and am able to add a mount with an LED light and mic to."
"OR";"I love these. They fit great and are pretty flatterIng. I even bought a second pair. The price is great especially working on losing some weight."
"OR";"Works as advertised.  It's being used in an insulated storage shed that tends to get damp at times.  This thing gets the air flowing and is easy to use."
"OR";"I THOUGHT THEY WERE BIG ENOUGH AT THIS SIZE TO BE FUN FOR HANDGUN SHOOTING, AND THEY ARE NOT. THE INLAID TARGETS ARE TOO SMALL TO DISTINGUISH FROM 15'-17'. I'LL GIVE THEM TO MY BUDDY RIFLE SHOOTERS TO USE UP, SO I'LL SAY BAD CHOICE ON MY PART."
"OR";"Apart from tearing down the government like a corrupt entity, this movie is a funny, romantic, and idealistic view of what government should be. Clean, and fun for the whole family. Great lesson on helping and serving others."
"OR";"Is ""cliffhanger"" a new buzz word?  If you've watched a show like Dexter, that is pretty normal.  I watch Dexter by the season, so I guess its different when you watch 5 episodes in a row. This series, same way =)"
"OR";"Great item, good quality. Just they do not fit Whithmor mesh storage cubes, too big for them. I though that company suppose think about compatibility between own products."
"OR";"Good bottle for water and other drinks. Plastic is ruining our society and now is time for us to stop buying food and items that will kill us and take a future from our kids."
"OR";"I enjoyed this DVD because it showed me all of China including Tibet. Also I could take some Chinese lessons. If you see this DVD, you will really want to see cute pandas in China!!"
"OR";"I picked this up, expecting just another short story.  I found, instead, a doorway to an epic world, one which I wanted to visit again.  What becomes of the Withlings, so peaceful and harmless?  Where is all this leading, and why? I had to know more, so I got the next installment."
"OR";"Well made machete with a well designed holster. Holster is made so it will set at an angle on the belt for easy extraction. Blade is supper sharp and should be handled with care. I would recommend this item if you need a good machete."
"OR";"This young author writes an emotional, touching story od a teen girl with choices to make. An unlikely woman appears to help her.
A thought provoking book for parents and teens alike."
"OR";"Fun family-friendly game, even for those of us who find sushi disgusting.  A little repetitive, and I can't help but complain about there being no easy way to keep track of score."
"OR";"i got this item to go on my 22 rifle. looks and seemed to work great. took it to the range on my 22 rifle and i couldn't even seen the red dot on the brightest setting. spent your money else where."
"OR";"Hey for $10 you cant beat this deal. I got both this one and the more expensive big brother... for the money this is the best bang for the buck and would not hesitate in buying anouther"
"OR";"These work nicely, but the actual ""holder"" for the
cannon battery is a ""sled"" that likes to fall off the charger..  I lost one sled, bought a second charger.  The second unit I taped that down."
"OR";"My 3 months old kitty really love this toy but it broke the next day. The ""joint"" of the suspender is too weak to withstand the pull. I just cut off the string and let my kitty have the mouse instead."
"OR";"It was a bit hard to fit an Apple's Iphone usb chager in the USB slot. I had to really push the connector in order to make it fit.
Otherwise, everything is OK."
"OR";"Absolutely wonderful. Great characters, great settings, good work the serial format was a bit of a turn off for me at first, but then I became accustomed to it and really was waiting for  every Tuesday to come around so I could ""get my OMWU"" fix."
"OR";"Excellent read by Kristin Hannah.  The perspectives of two sisters and the consequences of their decisions during World War II held my attention throughout the narrative. One of this author's best efforts!"
"OR";"I am really enjoying this series. It just gets better with Dance of Ghosts. I love the character development and having a real bad, bad guy. Can't wait to see how Watcher deals with all thats on his plate. Well done, Mr."
"OR";"These are not the greatest deadlifting socks. They're a little on the thin side for deadlifts. The huge benefit is that i do look like Flash Gordon, even though me shins are dripping with blood. It is better to look good than to feel good."
"OR";"I have all the Honor series and this is the book I like least.  Author seems to have run out of fresh ideas.  In fact, there were parts of the book where I was sure I had read in previous books.  Story line started out good but sort of faded out as the book porgressed"
"OR";"I didn't see size options when I ordered, so the one i received was too large but seemed to get the job done. The zipper can snag a little but otherwise no complaints."
"OR";"Handy ingredient to have in my cabinet for those moments when I realize I forgot bell peppers on my shopping list. They work well in omlettes and sauces, has a good taste, and is a good value."
"OR";"This amazing conclusion to the selection series will satisfy any teen.  I have suffered through the books with America and was floored by the ending. I recommend this book to any teen who enjoyed divergent, delirium, and matched."
"OR";"My 12 year old daughter bought this to read about the doll she had rec'd for Christmas (Apple White) and absolutely loved the story.  Very sweet and endearing and she really enjoyed the examples of good girls that Shannon chose to write about."
"OR";"This precurser to The Lord of the Rings is a wonderful lead into the much deeper work. It gives background into the former. Although it is not as well developed as the later work-it is truly wonderful and not to be dismissed as inferior."
"OR";"Usually a dependable author, this time I could care less about the characters. A by-the-numbers serial killer fable, with a killer dumber than most, luckier than most. I hope for better the next time."
"OR";"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the w"
"OR";"I really like that she keeps everything under 30 minutes. Great workout. If you eat less then you can definitely lose the weight. I use this to maintain and it's a good workout."
"OR";"I'm so glad Byron finally found out the truth about his father at the end of the book!  That in itself is a hard pill to swallow but it needed to happen.  Integrity is s smart cookie and I love her forethought in this book. Can't wait for next book!"
"OR";"I wanted this knife as soon as I saw it. It is a great knife. It arrived promptly. I had no issues with purchase, delivery or quality. I anticipate using this for many years to come."
"OR";"Work great, seem to last long, used them to cut over 400 metal studs and only used 2 blades. Very happy with the quality and the seller."
"OR";"Love this dress!  It is lightweight and has unique lines.  I am tall 5'11'' and it was long on me...that might be an issue for shorter people if they don't intend to wear very high heels."
"OR";"only found on amazon for me. only amazon provides you with quality hdmi cables at fractions of the cost. its impressive and you don't always need those lengthly ones to get the job done."
"OR";"Really classy, smart shoe with very feminine lines, a decent heel and very comfortable to wear.  May order more in different colors, perfect for dresses or dress pants."
"OR";"I was very disappointed with the theatrical release of this movie, especially since I was a big fan of the first two. This Extended Edition definitely helps fill in the blanks that were missing in the theatrical release."
"OR";"These are comfy cotton knit pajamas.  They are not super-warm winter PJs. I find fleece too warm for sleep, and these are just right under my quilt.  They are nice and soft. A good price for a basic PJ."
"OR";"Cheese cloth was brand new, arrived in great condition. Excellently made. I use it for making loose leaf tea. Would recommend to others."
"OR";"I really liked the first five stories. The sixth story felt like it was not finished. I am sure that will be solved in a future set of books. The characters are well written and interesting in most of the stories. And the author wrote about most kinds of paranormal creatures."
"OR";"Ginger is happy to consider this a treat or to eat something that's not her favorite if this is on top. I wouldn't use it too often in our case because she's little, old and fat, but for bigger, younger, skinnier dogs it should go over big."
"OR";"It's been a while since I've finished a book by Ian McEwan feeling more than satisfied, probably not since On Chesil Beach. From 1997-2001  it  seemed he couldn't miss. Then came a few rocky bumps including Solar, which was plain awful and stopped me from reading his books.

The first 20 or so pages"
"OR";"Waste of money.  The batteries only last for max 20 hours (if at all).  What is the point?  Batteries are almost more expensive than the string lights.  I have never ever given a 1-star rating, there is always a first... and appropriately so."
"OR";"Fat Head does what Super Size Me failed to do; it entertained its audience, yes, but not at the expense of getting out its message. And the message is clear: we've been duped and had the wool pulled over our eyes for too long concerning nutrition in America. I was already familiar with the material "
"OR";"Very nice set to have, had the set on a fender doing my job and had quite a few other mechanics throughout the day asking me where I got the set, plus saved almost $300 from not getting it off the Mac truck!"
"OR";"Nice set of books for paper backs. I enjoyed the fact that they were all boxed together and the binding, for a paper back, has held up well after several reads."
"OR";"nice fit (exactly as the size chart).No fatigue no nothing after 9 miles running. Very pleased. Amazing buy. Im gonna buy again"
"OR";"I previously bought  the size 36, and they were too large. These do tend to size on the large size, so go one size smaller. The 34 fit me perfectly. Soft cotton. I like them.  Not as solid as other brands, but still, a good fit and look."
"OR";"Great sleeve except it's so snug that you wouldn't be able to fit the surface in it with the keyboard on. I have to remove the keyboard and put it on the back pocket. Other than that, I love the design, material, magnetic closure, and the designated loop for the pen."
"OR";"Exactly as advertised.  There isn't much that you can write about small lights, but these do burn very brightly, and flash through all the colors after warming up for a few seconds.  They were sent via USPS, and received in about three days."
"OR";"These are SOOOOOOOO Beautiful! I love these!!! I had the gold version before and they lasted about 3 years before the paint started chipping. These are not going to last a lifetime but that is okay -the price is right and they just beautiful."
"OR";"Worked great with my USB 3 dock to give me a third monitor since I needed to change the Display Port on it to a DVI or VGA for the monitor I was using.  No issues, and can't beat this price.  Shipped quickly."
"OR";"We bought these for our 3 and 5 year old daughters Halloween parties at school. They were a big hit! It's now mid November and the rings they kept are still intact despite being rough housed and yanked around by both of them."
"OR";"I bought this to replace the one I have had for 5 years. I think the old one just got wet one to many times. and in the summer daily swimming."
"OR";"All the characters are back with a few mire sprinkled in. Sonia has her nose knee deep in another mystery. This time with ghost hunters. This is a really good mystery and has some relevance to our culture today."
"OR";"Although I am not completely convinced these work, we are on our third bottle. We have noticed that the dead spots are decreasing but we still have them occuring. We just moved to a new home so I look forward to seeing if there is any difference."
"OR";"I returned it,One Size fits all is complete false. I am a petite lady so the Garter from the panties to the thigh highs were to long. So if your short this will not work unless you have long legs and a short torso."
"OR";"Short story all the details are there but it moves quickly. The romance is sweet but if your looking for a long or more complex story this isn't it. The story is well written and the characters are great. Would like to see another book to continue with the brothers love life."
"OR";"great for hunting but do not use for sighting your scope. Blade is not strong enough to be stopped by wood. The bolts passed through the target and hit a woos fence. The blades did not handle the wood and broke."
"OR";"Very disappointing and not worth what it cost.  Didn't really say anything.  Suggest the authors take their own advice and quit.  Pleasant enough to read for the very short time it occupied."
"OR";"Excellent product and fun for the kids. Be careful when installing the shower head. The device is all plastic and could crack if you OVER TIGHTEN the shower head. Also use thread tape."
"OR";"This is my first book by this author and I loved it. cant wait to read her next book. the Jerra and Darrell storyline was so emotional and sexy all at the same time."
"OR";"very nice. it works well for a 6 inch nexus 6 and a 10 inch asus tablet.  it is very elegant.  admittedly the price is quite high for a price of metal."
"OR";"I do like that you can point the draft in all directions. however, it's insanely flimsy. also the frame is smaller than the register I had there before. there is a small gap that is not being covered at the edge. my old register covered the gaps just fine."
"OR";"This novel explains so much about the history of the European Jews and what auful lives they had during the second world war. So sad to read but we need to know about how horrible one race Germans can be to another. Why was this allowed to happen?"
"OR";"Nice Raspberry Pi heat sink set.  Probably not needed as the RPi always seems to run cool for me.  Maybe with 100% video decoding running.  Other looks good."
"OR";"I enjoy watching the Murder She Wrote programs and so I ordered this product. I received the product in a timely manner and the condition of the excellent. I am truly pleased with this product and I would purchase from this seller in the future should an opportunity arise."
"OR";"Always a big hit with one of my Granddaughters. She loves the entire line and does have most of them now. Yes...there are many of them to play with but she and I play with them every time she is with us and has most of them at her home. I only have about 60 here."
"OR";"Will last until I lose them. These are heavy, heavy duty stainless. You'd have to hit them with a sledge hammer to crush them. I haven't done much with them yet but so far so good. Definitely happy."
"OR";"If you want this series for the sex, it is great. Unfortunately, at the end, it starts to kind of get a story line and that replaces the sex. If you're looking for a story, get the bundle. If you're looking for sex, get the individual books."
"OR";"Working  OK so far, wish their was more space between the tank and the pump bracket, It was a real bear trying to get the pump bolted down,  Also not real easy to bolt it to the floor."
"OR";"A wonderful little short story. Definitely worth the time to read. Can't wait to read the next installment and see where these two go."
"OR";"Socks are socks I guess but I specifically ordered these colored ones so my husband stops stealing my socks and they came as the same exact ones he has. Oh well.  They just have orange letters and are all white."
"OR";"I absolutely love this harness for my Yorkies. So nicely made and pretty! I always used harnesses on them and I really LOVE how this one fits and looks. It is not cheaply made like some I have purchased in the stores. Im ordering another one for my other yorkie."
"OR";"Little thing runs well. I like it. It's quiet and pushes a good amount of water for its size. It also doesn't run very hot which is why I bought it."
"OR";"Well made tools.  They are pretty long(  9-3/4"") and not petite, so keep that in mind.  They won't work for *really* small work, but they are pretty versatile."
"OR";"I love how simple and straight forward these smoothies are to make. I can see myself definitely trying a lot of these smoothie! It matters not if your a die hard Paleo purist or a regular health foodie, you're sure to enjoy these smoothies!"
"OR";"I got These and they fit nicely, but I wasn't a fan of the metallic gold sparkle. Overall if you like that Id get them Im between an 7.5-8 and these fit well."
"OR";"Works great - I installed this on my daughter's computer for use with bluetooth headphones - no issues at all.  Her computer does have Windows 7 - which has somewhat complicated bluetooth configuration setup - but that isn't the fault of the adapter."
"OR";"Eliza (Ellie) Prentice and Thaddeus Sanborn are two damaged souls that have been running for far too long from their pasts, and from each other. A twist of fate brings them together again under life and death circumstances. Can they find the strength together to survive and the courage within themse"
"OR";"Very Good light! Nice size not to big not to small. Bright, excellent light for the money. Looks like it will last a long time."
"OR";"Like the product, purchased two and fits my S&W M&P 40 full size and 9MM shield.  Nothing special about it.  Four stars is a good rating for me."
"OR";"The ink is awful!! Plan to buy refill ink immediately. The stamp shows up so light on the paper it's really hard to even see it. The stamps themselves are adorable and the only reason we didn't return it!"
"OR";"Period piece with characters you enjoy following. Story keeps your interest. Heroine forced to endure and overcome. Is that not our point in life. What fun to be a part of this series."
"OR";"Nice, simple, basic, small.  Purchased as a gift, so I can't speak from experience, but I did open it up and look at it.  Was a good fit for a small Nikon Coolpix."
"OR";"I have to admit when I first saw this, I wasn't about to purchase it, but I caved in and purchased it anyway, I wasn't impressed with this, and wished I had kept my money. After you hear this, and I must say, the music isn't even from this famous show, and that was the let down."
"OR";"Loved getting getting to read more of Lacey and Cole's story from Poker Flats. Can't wait to read the next book in the series!!"
"OR";"Have bought several of these for several bikes. The are the best because they are wide, strong and stiff for hard to remove tires but clip together for compact storage in saddle bag. Never snap."
"OR";"Average boots.  Not  good for frequent use.
Bottom  has holes after approximately three uses.
 It would be better to spend more money and get a higher quality boot."
"OR";"Kinks and slides.  I have a small home gym and 20 square feet of this.  It's always kinking up and doesn't ""lock"" very well.  It is on carpet, so that's probably the real culprit.  It does feel nice on the feet though.  So I keep it."
"OR";"Sad but true, the dimmer switch as soon as we just it it, it quits working, 1 out of 10 tries we could get the light to work.
Check all wiring , it defiantly is the poorly constructed switch."
"OR";"Works like a charm. I'm using this on my Bose Wave radio  listening to Sirius XM off my phone
 BUT I had to disconnect the CD changer for it to work properly. This is a Bose issue  not the adapter."
"OR";"Really liked this trilogy. Read all three one weekend. Great characters in all the books.  Loved all the Girls and their choices of life direction."
"OR";"Cable works fine-hubby thought it was crap until he discovered the little plastic caps on the end. Once he got it hooked up to the TV and soundbar he stopped calling it crap and started calling it awesome."
"OR";"I like garys bikinis much better. This I like the idea if a pouch so your privates feel secure. like the look. But not the fit. - am 170 - 5'9''. Athletic."
"OR";"For the price, this hutch is excellent. Not super-sturdy, but I'm not gonna be tossing it on the back of a truck and driving across the country....so.. yeah, it's a great indoor home for my little tortoise this winter!"
"OR";"Very sturdy little chair and when they say it holds 300 pounds, they mean it.  The only thing I miss is the back doesn't recline, but I use it as a work chair, not a relaxing chair."
"OR";"Gutted!!! I really don't know how else to describe how I feel right now. You have done it again Megan, and I am so anxiously waiting for the 5th installment to Filthy. Bravo I say, BRAVO"
"OR";"Doesn't take up much room in the drawer and it's easy to take apart to clean. It's got a good edge on it and feels nice in my hand.

Edit: One year later this little wheel is still going strong."
"OR";"Its a really snug fitting case.  I haven't worked with the case enough to get the gun where it slides in and out easily.  Also tends to slide the slide back when trying to insert into holdster since its a tight fit."
"OR";"Poor, misguided, drunken Superhero Hancock, seems to have lost his way along with his memory. Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger.  Among those he saves is Ray,"
"OR";"I have a caldera,tornado and a volcano epx pro and it is a beast I have flipped well over a hundred times and jumped it just as much they are built like a tank and very fast I suggest a nanotech battery it is insane fast"
"OR";"This is the remote that should have come with the TV, like the keyboard for doing searches on YouTube.  Would recommend this remote to Vizio ""smart TV"" owner who didn't get one with their TV."
"OR";"The beauty and emotion of this portrayal of two very different worlds coming together was well done. I'm brought to tears every time I watch it. The soundtrack is consuming and hypnotic."
"OR";"Decent movie and it kept me watching to know what happened at the end, I will say I wanted it to be a little better but it was good and worth a watch.  I did see it on best movies of the year on some lists and I don't know about that but it was good for a low budget movie."
"OR";"I couldn't test it in America, but it worked perfectly in the field and saved a lot of time, space and clutter. It handled 2 iPads, 2 iPhones and a camera battery recharger. It did fine for 3 weeks."
"OR";"I was very excited about this for my nephew who LOVES these animals. When I got it in the mail, the paint on the face was much different than the picture and very faint. It did not look near as cute as it did online. He was still excited to have a new animal for his ""habitats"" though!"
"OR";"Very great read keeps you on the edge of your seat its a must read book I would advise everyone to get and read so far so good"
"OR";"Better quality than I expected. I'm going to order more. Has held up well in the wash. I've only washed it about 4 times. I lay it out to air dry."
"OR";"It's fun fun fun.. I think I bought just in time, my son is 10 months and loves music, tapping and rolling with it... The music is appealing, my son bounces to it"
"OR";"This hat is awesome!!! It has truly exceeded my expectations. Great detail, very sturdy, a all around great hat that my son LOVES. It is not a cheap costume accessory, but an awesome cowboy hat that is well made and will receive lots of play!"
"OR";"Purchased as a gift for 8 y.o. boy--he loved it and shares it with his 6 y.o. brother
Rather easy and straightforward assembly by their dad
Quick delivery---Easel is everything promised---Recommend--Would buy it again!!!"
"OR";"Great cheap pair of headphones.  Sweat doesn't seem to bother them.  They seem indestructible.  Sound is good.  Super-light.  You can barely feel them.  Great for jogging."
"OR";"Perfect! Fits the python perfect! If you are debating on weather or not to get this or the bigger, go with the bigger. They aren't as big as you think, even though the length is correct."
"OR";"This is a very powerful and strong little holder!  Garmin does it again! It doesn't shift or loosen with use or when manipulating the GPS.  It's the bomb-diggity! Not to mention that it literally costs pennies!  How can you  not love that! (smile) Enjoy!"
"OR";"I bought this really for memories. I had one of the original ones carried it every where used it hunting pheasant in Michigan, hiking in the Sierras, motorcycling in the Yukon, and I wore it out. So I now carry it for the memories. and it. works too. Helps me to find my car in the lot."
"OR";"This was a great find. After the floating season started all of the Costcos ran out of the Relaxation Station.. I found this and it was decently priced with all the great add ons!!!

The shipping on fast too!!"
"OR";"Well this is the second one, the first was returned due to a leak. Thinking that everyone as a defect here and now, and give it another try. This one the LED does not work!!!"
"OR";"This ran a bit too big and it really wasn't that comfortable. After I washed it a few times it really stsrted looking crummy.  Since purchasing I donated it to a thrift store."
"OR";"This item does not look like it will take much abuse but it's for an emergency. I took it out of the packing it came in and vacuum packed it and it compressed down real flat.. I would have given 5 stars if I thought it would last a little longer."
"OR";"Easy to install, looks nice. The lighted button has a nice illumination. I wish the center button was a little more sturdy. Overall I am satisfied with this product."
"OR";"I had to watch this episode for one of my master's classes and it was my first foray into Mad Men.  I liked it and ended up watching seasons 1-3 via Netflix.  The quality was good but my computer had to keep rebuffering it based on the speed."
"OR";"I loved this book, right down to the last pages I was not sure what was going to happen  Sparky and Bonnie had a mountain to climb and I won't spoil how it ends , all I will say is WOW"
"OR";"Excellent price and excellent product. I will fallow buying to you for the good price. In Costa Rica, it cost about $10.00 each one. Panasonic is a very good product."
"OR";"My cat loves this food and it is just the right amount. The food looks pleasant and smells good. I usually gives this to my cat for lunch and she eats all of it right away."
"OR";"These have worked well for my 2 year old. I love the button on the side of the headphones  - it mutes the volume so I can tell her something if I need to. We took this on an airplane and don't have any complaints to date. The volume seemed to be loud enough to hear."
"OR";"As with all of the Lucas Davenport/ Vigil Flowers series of books, I found "" Storm Front "" equilly as entertaining; as usual ,all the twist and turns of a great plot, intelligently written, so the reader is taken on a great crime adventure!"
"OR";"Great and fun looking sculpt. Comes nicely off his base, but some of the yellow speed bolts are a little fragile, word of warning. Otherwise a very fun interpretation of the Flash"
"OR";"It started out really well and peak my imagination right away, but it went on and on about her imaginary boyfriend and just skimmed the surface of her being a witch. I found Jane's relationship with David and Neko more interesting and fun and wanted more of those then all her other ones."
"OR";"If you are a college student and find APA, Turabian or other styles to be a challenge, this book takes the guess work out of it all.  A definite plus for writing college papers including graduate and post graduate level work."
"OR";"It worked great but, you would just be better off buying a new flashlight at this point.  The CREE LED flashlights cost less than $5 and work great"
"OR";"Fit like a glove in our 25 year old fishing boat. Took five minutes to swap this out with the bad unit. Came with new gasket and mounting screws, witch was a real plus."
"OR";"sorry but this helmet was very bulbous and awkward to wear. i was expecting a more low profile and snug fitting helmet, what i got was something that made me look like a beluga whale."
"OR";"Very fragrant, could smell it through the packaging. Long lasting, too. I used half a wax cube and can clearly still smell the lemon scent 12 hours later. Will definitely buy again."
"OR";"Received the pump on time and put it to use right away.  The pump is performing very well and it is quiet, in fact ordered a second pump.  I highly recommend the pump and the seller."
"OR";"The bamboo wood grain looks great and feels solid.  One thing I'd like is a way for the movable sides to have a way of locking down when expanded."
"OR";"Good concept but the suction cups aren't strong enough to hold this up it keeps falling down on my child especially when they go to get the ice cream bubbles out with the lever."
"OR";"What a gorgeous cup in such a gorgeous box. I'm beginning to collect mismatched teacups and this is my newest and favorite. What amazing quality and so pretty. Arrived perfectly safe in Amazon shipping. Very happy with my choice."
"OR";"the kitties love the friskies and i love having it delivered to my door. yee haw,  it came to the door, i unpacked it and fed the cat pak. full bellies = afternoon nap."
"OR";"Ordered these for my son. He loves them! Says they are the most comfortable boots he has ever warn. He did say they are a bit more ""cowboy boot""  looking than he thought they would be. Other than that, no issues."
"OR";"Exceptional deal for the amount of twine.  We used this to wrap Christmas gifts this year.  Carries the expected oily feel and petroleum smell sisal twine seems to have."
"OR";"It is somewhat cute, but very cheaply made. It reminds me of the stuff you get from China for next to nothing. It isn't awful, but nothing spectacular.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"OR";"Both were able to pickup the rules quickly at the age of 6. I enjoyed playing so much that I purchased the wooden gobblet game. This us obviously geared towards children and has less pieces."
"OR";"After trying 3 different models, this one it has the best reception from my phone and tablet!! It works as a transmitter too if you have an equipment without Bluetooth like an old mp3 player."
"OR";"I thought from the pic, it would be a lot larger then it is.  It is SMALL...it has the squeak in it..you pull out the tab, and whenever the kitty plays with it, it squeaks like a mouse.  It is very soft, and light weight.  Easy to carry around..."
"OR";"This book just keeps getting better and better. The characters are perfect and the story is very erotic and interesting. You are left wet and wanting.  You will definitely have to read more."
"OR";"We are enjoying this series and are looking forward to Season 2.  Love those murder mysteries and very glad to have a new one to look forward to with others being completed with BBC.  With this series they are able to adjust and write more of and new ones as well."
"OR";"I thought it would be bigger and more mobile!! The jaw it moves very good, but I thought it would be mobile on its limbs and tail!! I thought the texture it would be more realistic!! Not worth the money I spend!!"
"OR";"These slippers are SO comfortable. If you don't care too much about color click around to see if your size is cheaper in another color. I had originally wanted the light brown color but these were only $70 in the raspberry! So the choice was pretty easy then."
"OR";"For anyone who has some minimal knowledge about finances this is very easy to read and does provide practical, approachable things anyone can do.  You don't need a lot of money to retire if you understand what truly makes you happy and how really inexpensive and fun it can be."
"OR";"I really liked this book.  I thought the series was heading downhill, perhaps getting a little boring, but this one really reinvigorated my interest."
"OR";"Really liked this series due to it not taking itself too seriously! Characters are consistent throughout series. I will view future episodes if any.
Quality of video is awesome too! Again, thanks Amazon!"
"OR";"These are packaged a bit weird, can be a little bit annoying trying to get these in and out of the container they come in. If you intend to store these elsewhere then there's no problem. I believe I saw these cheaper at HomeDepot and Walmart. But these are still OK priced."
"OR";"This is a super rifle case , it fit my AR 300 B/O with silencer perfect . There is a lot of room for extra magazines . The padding is more than enough to protect the rifle and scope . Thank you for a super great product"
"OR";"If you are use to a standard video camera....do not purchase this item.  I had a sony HD handycam that lasted only 4 years...but the picture was outstanding.  I may send this camera back if Amazon will take it back......"
"OR";"The handle has a little cushion to it and the grating blades are so sharp it works so well, I threw my old one out (different company) it had gotten so dull over the years!"
"OR";"My two gerbils roll around and get excited for this more than bath powder and other chinchilla dust brands. Some people have warned against using this because the dust can cause respiratory problems but my gerbils have used this for months with no problems."
"OR";"The Jetwash  Firefly adds some nice abilities to the base ship. It also comes with more cards for set-up and story line. A nice way to add a player."
"OR";"pros: Excellent range, easy to install, hacker friendly

cons: none

other: works great with back track but you need to install drivers from there website"
"OR";"Great sound. Much louder than I expected. The Bluetooth signal never drops off and battery life is at least a couple of days worth of workouts. I haven't run the battery completely dead though"
"OR";"This is your basic t-shirt, good quality. fit as expected.
great color choices. Bought this to wear with black Vols overshirt; works great

if you want a great t-shirt by the District Threads perfect weight t-shirts, they are perfect"
"OR";"A story that keeps one guessing what will happen next while a complex mystery un-winds. Add a group of characters with their own intelligence, quirks, and humor and you have a lovable story."
"OR";"didn't realize mine was coming from china, took a little over a week, so not too bad.  Not really any brighter than the 3 LED I replaced with it.  No battery compartment, guess you have to unscrew the cover if battery needs replaced."
"OR";"Astounding ratchet wrench. Very strong, and really well made. Saves knuckles and sprains on those fasteners that just need that xtra boost leverage and force. It's worth every penny spent."
"OR";"My son loves these little grocery guys! This toy is cute and there's a little chute that the groceries can fall down through. Also a small spring to chute the grocery guys up."
"OR";"These are great for the first few months. A few of my pieces (the whisk and spatula to be specific) have fallen a part and I have since had to throw them away. The tops of them start to slip off and won't stay on while you're cooking."
"OR";"My cat goes nuts for duck. Glad we were able to find a good brand and the type he liked. Plus nice that it's available via subscribe and save."
"OR";"This is a book that has everything you need.  This book gives you love romance and mystery.  The story of Cole and Maia is the story of love that overcomes everything."
"OR";"My 3, soon to be 4, year old wears this every day. She would wear it out of the house if we would let her. It is very slim fitting. The 4T just fits her and she is 3rd percentile for height and weight (28lbs and 38 in)"
"OR";"Well priced and well made-- I want to get another one son-- gt this one for a puppy customer.  Would buy again."
"OR";"BRILLIANTLY designed this little Lalaloopsy horse will be sure to please! The additional Lalaloopsy little character, Sheri Charades is an adorable addition to our purchase :) CUTER than all the buttons in it's design, we're sure you will Lala-LOVE this wonderful set!"
"OR";"This is one of the best shows on tv right now. i love family guy. i love the slap stick comedy and the characters are great. My favorite character is of course Stewie, Brian, Peter. i love this show.

The best episodes for season 1&2 Are

5. A Hero Sits Next Door
6. The Son Also "
"OR";"I like it.  It's healthy for my Sam.  And delivered with no extra charge right to the door.  It's not any less expensive per can than at Tractor Supply but I don't have to stop and get it -- and so far, it's never out of stock."
"OR";"What a piece of junk. All drawer fronts were scratched up, particle board is extremely cheap. Took hours to assemble and was impossible to return. Don't waste your time, invest in something better."
"OR";"Streamlight quality and very bright small light. Programming the different modes was quick and easy, though switching from low to bright take some getting use to. Not sure how long the batteries will last but I have an endless supply of them at work"
"OR";"As with all of the Toms I've worn in the past, these take a bit of breaking in to fit each person's feet just right. But the look is great, and I'm excited to wear them!"
"OR";"It's among the top three favorites for the dog. She's a 20lb Shiba that destroyed the small size rather quickly so this time I got her the wolf size and it's lasting a lot longer and I think she likes having more to hold onto."
"OR";"This high tech gem is so attractive that it makes me want to upgrade my office. Super easy assembly, beautiful and works really well. This is a big, well-built desk lamp that I am very pleased with. However, worth the price?"
"OR";"We love this new lock on our door. You can program many different codes so everyone can have their own code so they don't forget it. We love the keyless entry instead of waiting on someone with the keys to open the door."
"OR";"Beautifully constructed tire. Made in Japan so they've got to be good. Low rolling resistance and if you have good rims they take very high pressure 115 psi."
"OR";"I received this product 2 months ago and I love it. I swim laps twice a week and it can be boring, being able to listen to an audiobook while swimming allowed me to stay focus. I recommended this product to a lot of my friends."
"OR";"We are over 70 years old and these lifts make kayaking possible. Without these, there is no way to get the kayaks on top of the car anymore. They work totally as advertised. You have to have the Malone J-racks to use them but it's worth the extra purchase."
"OR";"Although a good price, these smell like rotten fish. Brides - beware. Open at least a week before the wedding and separate your petals. I had to spray mine daily and the smell was still not gone."
"OR";"It isn't bad, good for the price.  However, it is shipped folded in half, and rolled up, so it takes a while to flatten.  It is very light, so movement (even walking) on it, pulls it out from under the furniture and it bunches up."
"OR";"Blood & Chocolate was a great read. Enjoyed Fiona's  personality. Would love to go on one of her tours. Hopefully one without a murder :)"
"OR";"The concept is a good one, but the execution makes for a frustrating day. The bra rolls up just below the breast and it will drive you crazy. I've tried pulling the bra tighter, to no avail. Because of this, I just can't recommend this bra."
"OR";"This is one of the books Janet Dailey was sued about and finally admitted to plagiarizing. Harper Collins took back all unsold copies at bookstores and promised not to reissue. Being printed by Open Door makes it ok?! Not in my book."
"OR";"Poor installation, did not apply well.  Lots of bubbles all throughout the screen.  I ordered another product from a different company and had to just take this one off and throw it away.  Just skip it and buy a different one, I recommend Coolreall"
"OR";"This cap is awesome!  I saw it on the show, Dr. Oakley, Yukon Vet and thought it looked like it would work for me while hunting.  Saves me from having to put a headlamp on.  Lights are bright.  Hat is comfortable.  Would highly recommend."
"OR";"My dog loves this ball and he cannot chew it and eat the ball.  It makes a little sound once in a while.  He even wants to take it to bed at night but I draw the line there."
"OR";"I loved this story of Lansing Lotte and his many women.  At times, I felt like screaming at him, but I think that is what makes it such a great story.  It's the kind where you feel deeply for its characters and want to either love or hate them.  I can't wait until the next one!"
"OR";"If you love strategy games, I can't recommend this game enough. It's the U.S. versus Russia during the Cold War and you can feel the tension as each side tries to control countries around the world. You get to live through most of the major events of that time period because they are actually played"
"OR";"It was a snap to install and these fit well in our kids closets, my wife uses these to organize clothes and other stuff.  If the closet is not a walk in and you need more space, these are great items."
"OR";"If you've seen and enjoyed this movie, you'll enjoy having it at you finger tips.  If you've never seen this movie then you better get it to see what you've missed.  Tom Hanks in his early years and fabulous !"
"OR";"I own 4 Mini Schnauzers.  This doggy door has been a dream.  We installed it on the ground level of our basement door.  I am no longer a door man for my dogs.  Yah!  My dogs learned to be completely potty trained by 4 months of age, since they could go outside when they needed to go.  The 2 flaps cl"
"OR";"ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT ! A++++++++"
"OR";"This is a slim case designed for all models of the iPad mini. The mini snaps into the pressure fit back and has magnetic three-section lid that turns the iPad of and on automatically. Good case with good value."
"OR";"I wanted to use it as a signature pad but it didn't work for my needs. It appears to function well for graphics arts but I'm not a graphic artist so I'm not an expert on how it should function."
"OR";"Following Dr. Fuhrman's program has made a huge difference in mine and my wife's lives. We have followed his instructions for some time now and this book is just the latest in a long line of phenomenal writings by Dr. Fuhrman."
"OR";"Cheap but sooo cute.  Everyone loved my black cat costumeplus its the only think I can come up with at 6.5 months pregnant.  I may get a couple more Halloweens out of it."
"OR";"Thinner than I anticipated so doesn't line up perfectly with the existing stuff we had and easily come apart if you do anything with lateral motion, but still decent padding and definitely better than our cement basement"
"OR";"I've own 3 of these compressors. This one is the best and most quietest. Hopefully it will last at least a dozen years. Sold the other because one was to heavy, the other was to loud and the other developed a leak."
"OR";"Works Great, Got this for my kids room, since the TV is mounted on the wall it makes it easier for them to change from XBOX to PS3 and to the fire Stick.

I purchased this for free or a discounted price to use, and to give my unbiased opinion"
"OR";"Work like a charm. Very bright and light weight. The rubber stretches enough to fit the under seat tubing. It has 3 modes which are easy to change through. They have a backing which has a good tilt to them which allows the light to be visible properly."
"OR";"These are some of the lower quality bike shorts that I have used, but they are cheap and have not worn out yet. The material is oddly stretchy and shifts around, but they seem good for shorter rides."
"OR";"Even though I bought the extra-large, it's way too tight. The pocket over the bust would appear very lumpy and awkward under clothes. The weave is very tight and it would be warm to wear."
"OR";"Not crazy about these. This is my second set. The first ones looked like a film was forming on the glass. I had them for quite a while so I didn't return them. Purchased the second set and they did the same thing. I have this pattern in the dishes and wanted plastic glasses because of them being in "
"OR";"Bought these to go with the Noah's Ark for my 2 year old great nephew.  Perfect in every way!  He is enjoying play with them so much."
"OR";"One of the more attractive, and durable plate holders. I bought it to replace a NY Giants holder that broke in the corner. So this was an upgrade. I may buy the same one again for the back plate."
"OR";"Katie Fforde novels are always a good read. Enough substance to make them worthwhile, and light enough to totally enjoy - even some laugh-out-loud moments."
"OR";"Its wonderful interactive fun that helps develop hand and eye coordination while playing with really cute physical renditions of Angry Birds.  I had to have them for collection purposes because I love Angry Birds a lot."
"OR";"small. but worked nicely. No directions, but I pulled them up from the site on Amazon.(Didn't need them). Took a couple of minutes to figure out,. I put $ in it for great-grandsons' birthday. Bought another for s grandson's birthday. Fun way to give a small gift."
"OR";"Perfect for my newly acquired rescue Cairn Terrier. Easy to put on and seemingly comfortable for him. I would highly recommend this company. The price is right also."
"OR";"Best socks ever!  Soft no uncomfortable sewing around toes area. The fit was amazing and I will only wear these sock. I bought these for work socks and my wife steals them."
"OR";"Desserts for my slow cooker!!! When I saw this I had to have it! I mean my son had to have it. I've made 4 recipes already and they are all AMAZING! This book is perfect...especially with the holidays around the corner. I really like the nutritional facts and the pictures for each recipe."
"OR";"This movie is just pure fun to watch. You can see many of the actors of the period including Gerte Frobe (James Bond's Goldfinger) in one of his comedic performances. Terry Thomas is hilarious as always."
"OR";"I have purchased several bathroom toy holders. This is probably number 4. I really like the size of this one. So far it is holding up on the bathroom wall. All the others began to fall at some point. My kids have not destroyed it yet :-)."
"OR";"Sorry to see this product was made in China. After the discovery of the bad dog food from China in addition to other things (lead paint in children's toys), I don't feel completely confident that these treats are not harmful."
"OR";"So glad I read prior reviews on this sandal for the sizing. I ordered an 11 Wide sandal in the Pewter color and they fit me like a glove. The sole is so comfortable--on my first day of wearing them, I had them on ALL DAY!!! Now I want them in other colors."
"OR";"this has kept my golden retriever very busy but it is not for a Rottweiler. it was torn apart in minutes by one. had to return and got one day shipping from amazon. great service."
"OR";"Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as"
"OR";"Nice laptop for a very reasonable amount of money, it came in pristine condition, the only complaint is that some of the description is not correct but if your are willing to put up with little thinks missing here and there it is a perfect laptop"
"OR";"Bought for 5-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl. Love the curtain feature! I have ours turned to the side so one child can cook and take orders through the curtain while the other orders their meal. Actually helps my kids get along."
"OR";"ok.. for those who think this is too weak.
The battery that comes with this, don't use it.
Get a fully charge battery and it will run much better.

it gets weaker when battery almost dead. and sadly the battery that comes with it is not good."
"OR";"Twelve self-contained stories of mysteries solved, some criminal. Entertaining, but the need to wrap up the story in one chapter prevents character development and more interesting twists and turns."
"OR";"This information is sold as fact, but in fact all of Sitchins translations have been double checked and proven to be wrong. Too bad I didn't find that out till after buying his books. I wish I could return them all."
"OR";"2 of these bulbs died within a few weeks in this 8pack so it pretty much was a waste of a deal for me. Also, these bulbs were a little too 'white' in terms of their brightness. I think I'll pass on these things next time."
"OR";"Colors are nice. Its a good quality heavy weight material. Not see through. Bigger than expected but my girls are petite with a thin body frame. In girls size they can wear 7/8 Medium or 10 large depending on brand."
"OR";"We have 2 yellow lab mix rescues that will eat anything.  We have several of these around the house.  I run them through the dishwasher to 'freshen' them and the girls think they get a new bone as it must smell better to them."
"OR";"My Boston Terrier could be the poster dog for this product. They're healthy, break without crumbling and the price is right. And, my choosy dog loves them."
"OR";"I ordered an XS for my 15  pound Maltipoo with a 20 inch girth.  Fit perfectly and is lightweight for the Florida heat.  No questions are ever asked by vendors about the authenticity of  my service dog."
"OR";"The first Kick-Ass movie was OK-to-Good. This sequel was simply awful, in so man ways. I couldn't even get through 45 minutes of it. Total waste of time and money."
"OR";"Pros:
Super adorable
Sturdy

Cons:
It's a little on the heavy side
the chain could have been a little longer.

Final Thoughts:
This was an adorable gift for those owl lovers. It was such a surprise when you find out that it's a USB"
"OR";"Very strong chemical smell, I bought these for self-massage per the suggestion of my massage therapist.  They work great but I had to wrap them in several layers of saran wrap to keep the odor contained.

As for lacrosse, bah, I have no idea if they are good or not!"
"OR";"I expected to love this jacket, unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations.  The material was okay, but it felt bulky. And the sizing was off.  Unfortunately my hunt for the perfect red ""leather"" jacket continues."
"OR";"Lost Wolf was a wonderful mix of lost and found. It had me in tears, and wishing Kane could remember who and what he had lost, and glad
about what he had found in a world turned upside down. I recommend you read the whole series. It's a great story."
"OR";"Wonderfully blessed to read this book. It inspires to keep searching for God's love and guidance. To keep trying to be the best you can to bring others to God"
"OR";"Awesome quality very strong and you can stand on this skylight covers as shown on some prodcut pictures. I'm stciking with Icon products for any of my rv roof cover needs"
"OR";"Works great.  More powerful than the old pump that it replaces.  I use this to pump water off the pool cover in the winter.  I do wish it has an auto-off when the water drop below a certain level.  That's not available for this model.  Oh well."
"OR";"I downloaded this book a month ago and I cannot believe that I waited until today to read. There are not enough words to describe how much I love this book and the characters in it!"
"OR";"I have the dual harness, and neck straps which I also love. I love this wrist strap for when I'm on the go (shooting live music mostly). It's nice for times when the harness is too much, but gives me the piece of mind of not dropping my camera!"
"OR";"I bought this bad boy on Craigslist for $75. Its amazing picture although I haven't figure out how to change the channels yet so all I get is nickelodeon

update:

turns out I bought a chalkboard with a spongebob sticker."
"OR";"I love my chacos.  I got the light ones because the regular ones are too heavy for me.  These are my first pair and they are replacing my teva's.  I took them to Universal and they worked for me ALL day."
"OR";"Great movie (in Dutch) about how things can so easily spin out of control.  So believable, so painful.  They give us great music and then kill it, a metaphor for how those whose heads expand so much that they kill everything, right Alabama?"
"OR";"I am very disappointed with this product.  The cheese slicer broke at the base of the handle in less than 6 months.  i used this product to  slice colby cheese  five to six times a week."
"OR";"Excellent book.  Well written but disturbing.  Fortunately we have progressed somewhat in our thinking and practices but there is a great deal more to be done.  The right to privacy and the authority over what is done with our tissue and organs should be the absolute right of the patient."
"OR";"Excellent product.  Everything as advertised.  With kayak carrying wheels and a truck bed extender I can handle it alone.  Easily transported in small bed pickup.  Grand kids, 4 and 7, love it."
"OR";"A great, sturdy set of utensils! Perfect for the EDC bag, or lunchbox. My husband works in a very strict work environment, so this not being metal is perfect! Haven't used it to eat yet, but hoping it holds up. Very convenient space saver!"
"OR";"this is a good summary of the years 1960-1963 but I found it too short and missing some events I think should have been added and that is why I gave only 4 stars, but in a whole it is well done"
"OR";"This cooler is the perfect size for a long weekend camping.  It is lightweight, easy to clean, and drains quickly.  It is basic and without bells and whistles, but it gets the job done."
"OR";"These were my size but too baggy on my legs and a little too long overall. They were tight on my butt and loose at the waist, so I could not size down. Besides the sizing issues, the shorts were very comfortable. I would not wear these out, but just indoors due to sizing issues."
"OR";"My six-year-old loves his Playmobil sets. He has this one and the pirate tower and play with them with other sets and Legos. My husband and I love how these toys encourage imagination and free play."
"OR";"I loved the genuineness of Julie and Eric--they deserved each other. The plot was so fun--an aunt doing a good deed for her brother and ending up finding her best man--loved, loved it!"
"OR";"My cats favorite canned food. I do not know healthy this is, but it is the only canned food my picky eatters will touch. I have a fifteen year old cat that has been eating this for years so it must not be too bad. She is still as healthy as could be."
"OR";"The handle flips sideways when you pull it out, making it a whole lot easier for pushing/pulling the handle. I'd buy another one if I ever needed another."
"OR";"I have tuxes, white dinner jackets and a couple other things that I wanted to protect. These are awesome bags. Breathable and long enough for tux with tails. Glad I found them. Will be ordering more bags."
"OR";"As with every other milwaukee tool I've purchased, it sliced right through a 1"" steel stake in no time.  Has a lot of power, the guard is easy to switch, and no trouble switching the wheels."
"OR";"the Ryuko figure is so amazing, if you love the anime ""Kill La Kill"" fan or just a FIGMA collector you'll love it.

the item has arrived as scheduled , and the packaging  was very good."
"OR";"Some of the series is offered on kindle unlimited but not all. It's random. The series is not worth paying for. Zoey is annoy and immature. Dax is over possessive and unyeiding. Also: all the popular Earth saying are stupid in a scifi book."
"OR";"So glad to see this book is available on its own. We have it in a by book of Dr. Seuss stories but  I was happy to find this for my grandson who always asked to hear this story above all others."
"OR";"I had troubles getting past the first couple of chapters, but after the rough beginning the book becomes intriguing. I found that I could not put it down. The story was a wonderful story."
"OR";"Perfect. It gives just enough light and is light weigh but sturdy. I actually put this on the top of a tall secretary that sits in a dark corner of my living room and it really lights up the dark spot. I am very pleased."
"OR";"using 4 mounted on the ceiling for dolby atoms/ dtsx and they work great for it, sound good in multi channel stereo for music as well."
"OR";"Fun to watch but a mess. Jessica is good, as usual, but Joan and Kathy are TV movie-ish. Wish Jessica hadn't just had a face lift though... her oddly pulled face put me off."
"OR";"These are great!  Especially for docking or using to keep two boats together in open water.  Very nice looking and seem well made."
"OR";"Wide range of adjustments allow for splash protection on a variety of boats.  It would be nice if the perimeter had a more rubberized material to grip on the cockpit rim a little better."
"OR";"This really disappointed me , it looks like advertised but it's very soft no structure to it (floppy) unlike other clutches I've purchased this one I would've liked if it was made with structure."
"OR";"It is pleasantly smaller than expected. The hooks fit the headphone strap but they don't dwarf my headphones like I thought they would. The thing itself it more flexible than I expected. It's not alarming but I just expected cast aluminium or plastic but this is soft rubber."
"OR";"Fluxx is not a stand alone game. I missed that part when I ordered it, although I should've caught the fact that it's an expansion game. I'll update when I get more to add to the game. Sounds fun."
"OR";"I just installed mine, and it works wonderfully well. Very bright, and even my dog can turn it on when he walks by. I expect to get many years of excellent service out of it."
"OR";"Excellent novel. Terrific character development. Very nice take on what children of parents who divorce then send blended families of children back and forth. Ending was a bit weak."
"OR";"What a crazy story. I absolutely loved this one. Marbles and Jen sure make quite the team. I loved the twist on how shifters came to be."
"OR";"I purchase this Torchiere Floor lamp to replace a 300 watts Halogen torch lamp. It works well.  I only wish Brightech make a brighter version of this type of lamp because there is market demand."
"OR";"Holds enough for 8 kids at a  party and so cute! Easy to fill. The only issue is you have to provide your own stick. Brooms are far too large for toddlers so we ended up taking the stick off the plunger, washing it thoroughly, and using that. lol."
"OR";"I enjoyed reading this book very much. There were a few twists and turns that made this book really stand out over the usual mail order bride books."
"OR";"Cats hated that i'm wiping them with this but to me the smell wasn't strong and it is a heavy duty wipe, thick and strong, i recommend it .:) I don't use it often, maybe once a month or so."
"OR";"I used to have an adapter which fit between the fixture and the regular bulb.  It added about an inch and was ugly.  This takes care if it without making the bulb longer and sticking out from the fixture.  I purchased again for my other porch, and we just leave the switches on all the time."
"OR";"great characters..great story!!! just plain entertaining!!!
i really had a hard tome putting it dpwn. i went on too read the whole trilogy and was disappointed because it ended :)"
"OR";"I an using them on an old Stinger shop vac to clean out my pellet stove (I know, I know you're not supposed to) and am not getting the dust all over the house.  The stove and ash is completely cold before I start."
"OR";"For your puzzle-solvers and thinkers, this is the toy series to go. Has multiple 'levels' and different kinds to stimulate their critical thinking skills and puzzle-solving ability. Son absolutely loves these!"
"OR";"My cats -- a kitten and an adult cat -- both enjoy this. I intended it for the adult, but the kitten digs into it, too. I bought Kitten formula and they both like that as well. My cats are growing and thriving and happy. I couldn't ask for anything more."
"OR";"I don't normally watch movies with subtitles but am glad I did this one.  It was surprisingly good and as a sci-fi/fantasy fan I like the premise of the story.  If you don't mind the subtitles and want to see something a little different, I recommend this film."
"OR";"Perfect fit. I have a 33 waist, used the size chart and ordered the 32 (which they said was good for a 32-33 waist) and they fit perfectly. Suggest that if you're closer to a 33-34 waist, to order the 33 instead."
"OR";"This was an okay read, it kept me turning the pages wondering what was going to happen next. I love Ashley's books and will continue to purchase them, keep them coming."
"OR";"This Asus Zenpad 8.0 Screen protector has met all expected needs for it. I really like this screen protector, it keeps me really comforted and not have to worry about cracking the screen. It was really easy to put on, and no problems with it."
"OR";"Excellent product. It wraps around the dog, protecting the belly from splashes, and there is a hole on the top of the neck for the leash. And yes, the sizes run small. My 40lb golden retriever needed an XL."
"OR";"Nice and thick, but I expected all different colors, like the picture shows.  You will only get ONE of those designs, not all 6 in a package.
I had a little trouble with the top being a little too high.  It hits the shelf above the rod so the divider does not move freely."
"OR";"Wasn't sure what'd I'd find behind the old Aprilaire thermostat I was removing so I purchased this. I'd totally recommend this even if you're not needing to cover issues. It makes it look way nicer."
"OR";"I really enjoyed this story, the back and forth telling of the two sisters was great. I hated for it to end. Thank you for a another great read."
"OR";"Nice box and kitten uses it. Like cover to entrance but it falls off too easily. Filter on top keeps the odors away. Would recommend."
"OR";"Excellent. Easy to use. Product is as good or better than description. Highly recommended with over 25 years of rc experience, I have seen and used it all."
"OR";"I thought this was a nice garment but about 2"" smaller around the chest than bras I wear.  I ordered a 38""
as usual but it was much too tight. When I measured it against the 38"" bras I have and this one was 2"" shorter."
"OR";"Keyboard cover review

I bought this in grey to protect the keys of my 2017 MBA. Not from liquid spills; this would only offer protection from light splashes, not a full spill. But from dust and crumbs.

The fit is really good, it lines up perfectly. It doesnt touch or damage the screen when the lap"
"OR";"I didn't even know I needed this bottle opener, and now I'm obsessed. Always conveniently located right on the fridge, but small enough that it's not tacky. Our friends always comment on how handy it is."
"OR";"I used this to display a Funko Pop doll collection. It's actually the perfect size. It would be perfect for cupcakes as well, just an FYI for nerds like me."
"OR";"I greatly enjoyed the Decker/Lazarus early books at the beginning of the series.  They were character driven and shared the lives of the main characters, Peter Decker and Rina, as their relationship grew into marriage and family.  More literary in writing style and with characters you came to care a"
"OR";"This was a most enjoyable read. The relationship between the two main characters was fascinating as were their personal histories.  I'd like to see this book as required reading in high schools."
"OR";"I was hoping for something a little more tabloidish. I'm glad I got to read it for free (Prime member) because I would have been mad if I had paid to read this one."
"OR";"Not at all satisfied with this DVD.  Especially the sound.  Just not at all clear and fades out in some scenes. Picture not the best in fact I have seen better.  Don't recommend this unless you are a collector.  Better DVDs out there."
"OR";"Thought since it was made of tough stuff that it would last awhile.  I hope the body lasts because the feet were chewed off within 5 minutes.  We have a black lab that is not a chewer."
"OR";"Perfect size for my 2 year old to drink fresh smoothies & juices. Quality stuff - made in Italy,  lead-free and plastic-free. The lids are starting to rust after a year, but maybe the rust could be cleaned off."
"OR";"The product does not work at all. Try to use it with every USB flash drive that works in all my other USB devices but to no avail. No sign of life or sign of light for any USB mass storage device connected to it."
"OR";"However, it just doesn't feel right in my hand. I'm a huge fan of the Cara Cara 2, because it's a balanced blade. This one is about 5 grams off in the blade. Still it's a nice EDC blade."
"OR";"Liked the whole story except for the ending which was abrupt.  This is a short story but the author could have gone about ten pages more and given a lot better ending"
"OR";"This is an ok tool to have. When I first received it the safety pin on the handle spinner came off and got lost in the mail, I replaced the pin with a new one and made some adjustments to spinner to keep it in place, now it work ok."
"OR";"Bought it in black - amazing device with great sound quality, but a little cheap looking. The buttons on top look like very cheap plastic."
"OR";"Safe and easy to carry and open case. Fits the leapster just right and holds enough games for hours of entertainment. Good price for product."
"OR";"These actually work pretty well. For the price I was expecting pretty poor quality and thought they would leak it not work. They all worked and didn't leak!"
"OR";"Absolutely awesome! I bought the 100 and 55 gallon filter for a 40 gallon cichlid tank and a 38 gallon tropical. They work well and keep the tank crystal clear."
"OR";"Love this cable! My data throughput has definitely increased, and the cable being flat allows it to run beneath my large area rug undetected. Add the normal fast Prime delivery = this was a great purchase."
"OR";"Well done origin story of how Hannibal was ""created"". Horrific occurrences in childhood drove Hannibal to become the remorseless cannibal he became. Throughout the film I kept thinking of the future Hannibal, mesmerizing."
"OR";"This is just what I need for my application. I would have given it 5 stars but it is not stainless steel. It is galvanized steel. Seller should give the right description in the right up. This is misrepresenting the product. I was expecting stainless not galvanized steel."
"OR";"Engrossing loving tale of an abandoned child who became a famous violinist in the time of Vivaldi. The story of her coming to find her self and her place in old Venice."
"OR";"Maybe I didn't get the right size, but the underwire is killer.  On the left hand side, it pokes out and it rubs my arm... alot.  However, if it weren't for that, I think I would love it.  It is smooth and offers nice support...."
"OR";"For the price I bought 2. I am a little worried the grip, should it get blood on it, that it will become too slippery. For use on hogs, I think it will be fine. The hook is quite sharp too."
"OR";"I love! Warm and sexy. Goes up to my thighs. I'm 5""8"". If you have thick thighs I don't think it will go up too far on your thighs. Overall satisfied with this product."
"OR";"I loved the historical content as well as the romance in the entire series! I couldn't put it down ... and I wish there were more of Lily Graison's books to read (I read all 5 of them)!"
"OR";"These boots have a taller shaft than other riding boots I've owned which makes them look modern. The boots are attractive and comfortable and the full inside zipper makes them so easy to put on.  They run slightly large."
"OR";"I was looking forward to this book and it did not disappoint.  My only issue is the making deals with Beauregard.  I don't understand why Eddie did and now why pony boy did. I assume it will work out in another story, but still it's annoying and the reason it is four instead of five stars."
"OR";"I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Everything was just as described. The PC came loaded with a genuine copy Windows 10 and a 90-day warranty. The system is fast and responsive. Perfect for my needs."
"OR";"Attractive and comfortable, but not enough room in the toe box to accomodate morton's neuroma. I typically wear a 9.5, a size 10 was ok with thick socks, 10.5 was definitely too big."
"OR";"The sexiest short erotic story I have ever read.  Amazing job of getting so much info into a short book.  she went for the interview, got the job, but I don't think she really knows what she also said YES to."
"OR";"So far these are very nice for under the kitchen cabinets in my RV wired them into my vent a hood switch. Mine stuck very well and are still holding. Very Cool and white brite light."
"OR";"Very pretty and classy, and the shipping was excellent. Dress is just as described. Seller is great. Unfortunately I will have to return it size was not good for me. Great dress good for any occasion."
"OR";"This is a great book for everyone. It has interesting memory improvement techniques and 5 simple steps to learn easy and a lot more helpful suggestions. These simple techniques helped me to remember everything in my daily life."
"OR";"I liked the characters because they seem like every day people you know. To have a terrible event happen is shocking. But I liked how Julia carried on, yet stayed true to herself. This seems like a good series to follow."
"OR";"James Rollins never ceases to amaze with the adventures of the Sigma Force group.  Always a good read.  Hard to put down one of his books."
"OR";"This Heath Ledger film isn't supposed to be an historic epic. Rather a light spoof of the historic movie. Entertaining and I always like to watch the late Ledger."
"OR";"This unit works fine and the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would have preferred to purchase the one-button model but it wasn't available at a reasonable price."
"OR";"Like other reviewers, I thought these were a bit pricey, but they are worth it due to the ease in getting the ice cubes out.  I run mine through the dishwasher - no problems.  Good purchase."
"OR";"These are the best bottles made. They came well packaged, in new excellent condition. These bottles are so rugged, Ive only replaced 2 of them in the past 6 years."
"OR";"Love these sheet !  These are so warm and comfortable to sleep on during our cold Missouri winters .  I recommend washing these with a half a cup of vinegar along with your usual detergent, the vinegar prevents peeling ."
"OR";"Works as it needs, holds our half-grown kitten very well.  Whereas I prefer the stability of a hard-sided carrier, I do not have the space for such things and appreciate that this can store relatively flat.  Naturally, kitty is not a fan."
"OR";"I'm a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr. I think this movie hits all the right notes and lets us see Tony Stark as what he really is, vulnerable."
"OR";"Very effective even better than socalled 37 DB Titus hearing protection. Great price, way cheaper than the local gun shop product."
"OR";"Nothing special. The material and the prints are very average. They are comfy. They run small, it feels to me as if they had cut up one size and then stiched an elastic band of a smaller size."
"OR";"We have a farm, chores rain or shine.  It is so nice to always have dry boots to put on since we got this dryer!  It does a much better job than just setting boots by the fireplace or heater, it dries them quickly from the inside."
"OR";"Used this in a recently renovated bathroom.  Didn't realize how expensive the accessories were. Searched Amazon and found this product.  It was attractive, solid and inexpensive.  I would recommend."
"OR";"It has my seal of approval, and I fully recommend it.  I bought 2 of the Gizmode water alarm detectors, several sensor pad attachments, and 1 sump pump attachments.  Despite their very small sizes and nearly negligible mass, they all worked straight out of the box as I tested everything right away. "
"OR";"DANIEL DAY LEWIS...PERFORMANCE SUPERB! POSSIBLY HIS BEST PERFORMANCE EVER AND SUCH A DIFFICULT ROLE. SUPORTING ACTORS GREAT AS WELL.  ALL AROUND GREAT MOVIE BASED ON REAL LIFE ARTIST CHRISTY BROWN."
"OR";"Wonderful!  Jesse is my new actor crush.  Its not overly cheese, its sweet, def a rom-com.  I would watch over in a heart-beat.  You won't be disappointed, very glad I took a chance with this movie."
"OR";"Again, this  is a product I've been using for several months now, and I feel qualified to give a fair review.

It does the job... period.  You can adjust it to be stable as you ride.  Of course, a rough bump may knock it out of line, but you simply reach up and align it.  If you're a rough rider and"
"OR";"An excellent read. The best thing to happen is watching the movie after reading the book. It was like watching my imaginative characters in real life."
"OR";"Darn, I must not have read the fine print somewhere.  I bought these for a friend to light up her backyard for parties, etc. but they say ""Not for Outdoor Use"".  Disappointing.  They're also a bit hokey looking.  I guess you get what you pay for."
"OR";"The attraction between Bradley and Mia was hot.  It was amazing how Mia tried to fight the attraction towards Bradley, but it could not be denied. As time went on, the two became involved and fell in love.  Good story."
"OR";"I'm not usually a sci-fi person, but I did thoroughly enjoy the Divergent series. Four gives a more detailed look into this complex character, extending the reading pleasure for a few more pages."
"OR";"In the winter, it can be tough wearing skirts to work.  I work in the financial world and you have to dress up. I usually dread wearing tights because I find them uncomfortable, but I really like these.  The attached socks feature keeps my feet warm :)"
"OR";"loved the scissors style tool, the tweezers and the bulb syringe.  The yellow tool (pictured on the left hand side) was pretty cool, BUT it broke the first day of use.  The quality of that tool was not as good as the other three."
"OR";"I have read almost all of John Grisham's books.  this one was really different it is the first one regarding
Theodore Boone as the main character"
"OR";"Meh.  It came sharp.  Feels sturdy.  The blade shape makes it far wider than it needs to be and ends up being far too wide to carry everyday in my pocket."
"OR";"Good philosophy book. It was helpful. I needed it for a class otherwise I would not have rented it, but I'm glad I did. I would not have been able to understand what was happening without it."
"OR";"This is a well designed case. I love the way it feels and will protect the iPad air. It just seems sturdier than most other cases and will not slip off a table if bumped by a grand kid (extra bonus for me). I will be shopping this brand for other things, I think."
"OR";"Picked this up getting to lighten my load with the miles of hiking and tracking. Not realizing that the quality and strength of this unit is above amazing. Both tripod and monopod are exceptionally well crafted and sturdy pieces of professional gear."
"OR";"The Sparrow by Jason Mott is a good short story where you get a chance to read a sweet short story before you read the whole book, The Returned."
"OR";"This is a Beautiful little knife. The fit and finish is great and it is so small you forget your carrying it. Love this blade. It is a shame they discontinued this chairman series."
"OR";"Nothing like a NY hood story. Always drama!  Fake friends always come into play. Where is part 2 I'm ready to find out more."
"OR";"Good romantic story line, just enough fighting, but would loved if they had the baby within this story and to see their relationship solidified as a family"
"OR";"The mount is made out of metal, well made. The problem I have is the only two screw holes are set on a diagonal. I needed to mount it on the back of a cabinet and needed horizontally aligned holes. Now, its mounted on an angle, which is not all that bad, actually."
"OR";"This harness fits my dog perfectly and she seems very comfortable in it! I am extremely happy with it..and for the price, you can't go wrong!
I will agree with other reviews that the straps are a little difficult to adjust, but once you adjust it for your dog's size, you shouldn't need to do it agai"
"OR";"I've read two of Homes' books before and loved both of them.  When I read the awful reviews on Amazon, I debated whether to read it or not.  In general, I won't read a book unless it's rated 4 stars and above.  I really enjoyed this book.  The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that I reali"
"OR";"Sturdy and well made, and my cockatiel seems to be quite pleased with it.  The little clippy bit allows me to swap out the toy often to keep her interested."
"OR";"I appreciated the closure at the end.  I could envision the scenes as the descriptions were vividly written.  The story line well thought and not rushed. I finished this one in record-time."
"OR";"I LOVE that they sealed the bottom of this warmer! My last one was a gift and it lasted nearly 5 years... but the mice like to get in under the heater in winter (no duh, right?) and this fall, when I went to plug it in, the wires had been chewed. The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use"
"OR";"This Queen Sheet  collection is quite nice.  I will get back to my review after I wash them, the ultimate sheet test right?  It will be a surprise if these pill up - I was asked to give this review.  More when I wash them"
"OR";"If you need a beard for a costume because yours isn't grown in quick enough go this route.  Lots and lots of compliments and yes, it does look fake and yes, you'll fool no one, it's a costume!"
"OR";"I've had my ThinkPad for about a month and love it.  I'd had a 19"" Dell and find this 15.6"" light and maneuverable.  The keyboard is smooth and enjoyable to type on.  Have had no problems with wireless or internet connections.  All of my downloads have gone flawlessly."
"OR";"Another hit in the Sigma Force series. Great plot and non-stop action as usual.  I wish I had read all the books in order but it's not a big factor."
"OR";"I have put a good portion of time and thought into reviewing this product. Overall, I have determined it deserves 5 stars. I have taken several photos which show the condition when it arrived.

Pros:
Pretty comfortable, sturdy, back support, insulated container to place beverages into on the arm, ma"
"OR";"I'm a weird way I feel like this is a good book to read if you were ever curious about how your parents were raised. I love seeing all the differences between them and now."
"OR";"We bought this to make it easy to sort and transport Legos.  I wish the box were a little more sturdy, but overall, it works great and holds a ton of Legos!"
"OR";"We LOVE this stove!! This took things to the next level. It is very easy to use and cooks pretty evenly.  This made camping so much more comfortable."
"OR";"Start at the beginning, with this series, but definitely start.  It is a worthwhile trip!  The characterization is believable, the plot, too, and every time, hands down, the villain of the piece ends up being the one I did not want it to be!  How does she do it?  They are thought-provoking and enter"
"OR";"Hopefully, this one will last. The previous First Alert Carbon Monoxide Alarm I owned was supposed to last 10 years but only lasted 4.  Same with one of their smoke detectors."
"OR";"My 9 year old son wanted this so badly for Christmas. He loved it. Item was well packaged and seemed to be constructed nicely. He had gotten several hours of play out of it already and for the low price point, I am very happy with my purchase."
"OR";"This one was easy to fly. The trim control is for forward and backward movement. I set mine right in the middle and haven't had to touch it it flies really good."
"OR";"I bought this blade for making hole cuts in ceramic tile. The blade arrived & package states it's for cutting grout. There is no mention of tile. I'm debating about retuning the item. I'm disappointed."
"OR";"We like Vince Vaughn and this movie while it had its funny moments it also made you think, wow what if this really does happen?! People would marry each other not knowing they were related?!"
"OR";"Used with Nikon d5200. Water does not leak. The finger pockets are placed in the right position. The lens section is large enough for a long lens, but is kinda annoying for a short lens."
"OR";"Required for MN 4-H for advanced obedience class.  My lab hated it.  He doesn't pick up.  I want to try to float it in the lake and have him get used to it that way.  It as fine."
"OR";"Wow so good better than Last Call .  So happy for Gavin because once he fell for Ben he did not see anyone else n like Ben said, Gavin was it for him. Top the last one.  Thoroughly enjoyed Delicious."
"OR";"Love this tea set as does my 2 1/2 year old. She never tires of tea parties and I don't have to worry that she's playing with toxic plastic!!"
"OR";"I bought this reel based on Alan Hawks review.  I strung this reel with 300Yds. of 100Lb. Power Pro. After fighting bull reds in the surf with this reel I have to say this reel is a tank. Exceeds my expectations. I would have given this reel five stars for price point but will need to see the reels "
"OR";"Works nicely and keeps things fresh. The lack of the 5th star is due to the way it lines up and a little flimsy. Would recommend though."
"OR";"I bought this collar for dog walks after dark during the winter months. I have a white dog and would have to say that the dog is more reflective than the collar unfortunately. It seems durable, however I don't feel the dog is much more visible when we use it."
"OR";"Was going to buy it for a four year old orginally but think its too small.  It's perfect size for a one or two year old.  My package was missing four of the screws, but I had some on hand that worked. My one and two year old love it."
"OR";"I bought this for my granddaughter  to help her learn to manipulate turning, pushing, etc.
So far, so good.  She loves the pop up!  She has the most trouble with the turning one on the right end, but is learning which is the purpose.  Very cute, a classic toy box toy."
"OR";"We just renovated the kitchen and I didn't have the room to have the cabinet to be customized JUST the way I wanted....So I purchased this along with another one.  I was very impressed with the quality.  Rock solid heavy."
"OR";"This is perfect! It will stack in any order, it will spin as if they're tops, they will roll quite a distance on their sides as if they're wheels, my infants enjoy them and so does my 7 year old child."
"OR";"AWESOME, awesome, awesome! We use it in our entry way to hang keys and it's sturdy and has tons of character. Always puts a smile on people's faces when they see it."
"OR";"Patrick Calhoun writes an easy to read book. I started reading it this evening and could not put it down. I am excited to go shopping tomorrow and try these recipes. The pictures of the process and the completed product will be helpful when I try these dishes out."
"OR";"I fell in love with with Crixus while reading the Matilda Schmidt series. This just deepened my affection for the irreverent demigod and introduced a new favorite feisty femme fatale who can more than hold her own against his charms.

Can't wait for the next installment!"
"OR";"Just what I needed for all my vape supplies! All my juices fit up top, even 50ml bottles. I have all my atomizers and rebuilding supplies in the bottom racks. Just buy it. You'll be happy, I promise."
"OR";"just like in Disney world but much cheaper, and trust me the whole family was entertained when I used the toy and pretended to make it talk (great way to spend the hours waiting in line for rides) fun fun times"
"OR";"I am a mom of a 3 year old and I grew up playing this game and I want to teach him how to play this fun game. It arrived before delivery date so I was excited to get it early!"
"OR";"Elmo is adorable and my baby loves it but it sheds like crazy. There is little red fur everywhere. All you have to do is touch it and it loses fur. This thing is gonna be bald in a month"
"OR";"So much fun and we were thrilled to get this in our House Party pack.  I love how creative you have to be and this forces you to think outside the box.  Great for the whole family!!"
"OR";"I liked it but my wife thought is showed off too much of her boobs.  Definitely very sexy.  The model in the picture is a good representation of what you will get.  If you are big, you will show a lot."
"OR";"Tighter then I would like not sure how it's going to fit after washing and drying I should have bought the large, but it's quality sweater thick and warm the style is so sexy."
"OR";"This thing is great. Got it to capture my young daughter's attention and hopefully get her interested in science early. It's really lightweight and feels cheap in hand, but for the price you can't do better. Oh and my daughter loves playing with this thing."
"OR";"Not entirely successful in keeping my cats from scratching other things up. They still love the toy after they ripped it off the first day. Since I've got 1+ year old cats, they are a bit too big for it, but sometimes they still cuddle up on it."
"OR";"I've tried a bunch of cases at this point, and this is by far my favorite. Great fit, high quality materials, lightwieght, overall exactly what I was looking for"
"OR";"Liz and Landon have been together the better part of 4 years. She refers to them as peas and carrots. They go well together, but there is not a lot of excitement. They are busy, sometimes ships in the night.

Then suddenly, they are laying it on the line and he proposes. The excitement is back and i"
"OR";"I must have a dozen sets of hex keys but they are all missing pieces. This set holds the wrenches tight and secure. I also appreciate the range in sizes and both metric and SAE."
"OR";"I was able to watch my beloved Baltimore Ravens on my laptop while sitting in a parking lot Cody, Wyoming.  4-stars only because the picture quality could have been better, but, it worked as advertised."
"OR";"This knife is the first one that Gil Hibben and his son designed together. It is very well made and just the right size. The design is very nice and fits the hand perfectly with good balance. It comes with an excellent quality black leather sheath."
"OR";"this holds all of my toddler's bath toys and allows them to drain so nothing gets nasty or smelly. she loves to clean up when bath time is over but if we help the scooper is super useful."
"OR";"Mr. Reasoner's story of three different cultures coming together in this book is amazing and how the story
goes back and forth between them keeping you on the edge of your seat."
"OR";"I have enjoyed this series.  These characters are dark and beautiful. Their love is intense, but both are stubborn to no end. They are both missing each other and need each other. I just hope that Lucy can get out of her current situation with Alistair."
"OR";"They work with the Velleman VTSS5U, tin easily, stay clean and don't bend with a little pressure while working. Good for inexpensive kit work."
"OR";"I had previously wrote a 5 star review for this product. Sadly, after only 2 months the camera stopped working. I tried to contact the seller, but it appears that is not possible outside of the return window. Very disappointed."
"OR";"I absolutely loved reading this book. The characters were well-written, the plot was interesting and the drama was intriguing. I only gave it four stars because the romance seemed to be a secondary part of the story and a bit rushed. Regardless I am looking forward to reading more by this author."
"OR";"This bucket has helped me minimize my car-camping gear.  I used this on my last trip as my shower bucket.  I have a battery powered shower head and this was the perfect amount of water for one quick shower."
"OR";"This ball keeps my fur baby active for hours!! She loves to play fetch and this little bit of crinkle drives her crazy (in a good way)."
"OR";"Nothing special about this thong, more comfy than other thongs, for sure. It seems like it was simply cut from a cloth and then.... Voila! There were no stitchings around the band. Well, that's prob why it's 'invisible' because of no bulk. I like it though."
"OR";"My fur babies couldn't wait to jump on their new tower. The unit is well made, came assembled, and is very sturdy.  I just bought another one."
"OR";"Have purchased 3 of these, kids are very happy to get as a gift!  Works well, neat little product, fun to get moving indoors."
"OR";"Toby, our 90-lb ""pup"", got too old to get in and out of the SUV on his own.  The Petstep saved the day.  Easy to deploy, easy to fold and stow.  You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up, but only once.  Sorta like a child and a hot stove. Live and learn.  I don't really see any way to re"
"OR";"Live,love,loved this book. Great story line-we've all been there-a love that doesn't  work out so we harden  our shell so it won't  happen  again. Hot sex ,good  characters. You hit it out of the ballpark  for me. Now I  have  cucumbers on my grocery list  at 61. Not dead yet."
"OR";"I bought this book as a gift for my husband. He carries it with him wherever he goes, so it must be a very good book. He has commented several times that he is really enjoying it."
"OR";"Cheap, inferior materials.  I had been wearing these for years.  Over the last year (2 purchases), they stretch out, fade, and get holes within 6 washes/wears.  All of Hanes mens underwear is of inferior material and quality now."
"OR";"I choose 5 stars because these books keep my attention. All are very imaginative and fun to read. I have read the first 2 and will read any others that are in this series. I would ( and have ) recommended these books to my friends. I have added Ransom Riggs to my list of favorite authors."
"OR";"My son loves these.  He will spend hours looking through the pictures to find the hidden items.  Not the first, not the last.  We liked the Halloween one the best!"
"OR";"Daughter LOVES Bubble Guppies. This backpack is super cute! The price was awesome! Its a little tougher to find reasonably priced Bubble Guppie stuff."
"OR";"Taylor Lee never disappoints her readers! Red Rock's Rebel hold this true once again!!! Loved this series as with Taylor's other series! Can't wait for the next book to be released!!! Awesome Awesome Awesome :)"
"OR";"Very cheap. The food gets stuck in the blade. You have to take it apart, get the food out, then try to chop again. Who wants to cut up good before they chop it? Doesn't work."
"OR";"My pitbull LOVES to chew and pretty much destroys anything she gets her mouth on. This has held up rather well and she seems to enjoy all of the little nubs."
"OR";"I was able to upload photos on my laptop from my microchip.  Pro: It's affordable, ANKER has the best customer service and 16-months warranty! Con: Make sure it's inserted in to read the card."
"OR";"I have used this on both copper and brass recently with beautiful results.  I use a variety of patina solutions and cost per oz on this one makes it a great value."
"OR";"Another five-star book in the LOTU series! As always cannot wait until the next book is released and curious who's story will be told (please be William!)."
"OR";"This is the second pair of Addidas warm up pants I have ordered. Fit is comfortably loose around thighs and legs. Nice for working out in. Washes and dries easily."
"OR";"I do like stories that gives both sides.  I don't like a cheater though. That's the downside of this story.
 But yes I'm sure to read more of her."
"OR";"Great compact dishes for any size dog or cat, bunny etc
I hook them to my pocketbook or carrier.
I have a service dog and purchased them to have for her on a long airplane flight."
"OR";"Not OK if you are using with a tarp zipper. The tarp is not made of blue material. It seems to be sprayed with a blue coating. The blue coating comes off on the adhesive strips. I won't buy this brand again."
"OR";"This second in the Last Librarian trilogy is about a complicated future world where it is hard to tell the heroes from the villains.  The world is peaceful, but at what price.  I am starting on the third book immediately."
"OR";"It's all but impossible to get one of these that is not cloudy.  The wax formula used in these is not very good, and it doesn't take much shaking for it to diffuse into the water, making it so cloudy you can't see the wax blob at all.  It's pretty much a guarantee that it's going to be shaken during"
"OR";"Love this card.  So easy to install and connected immediately with my iPad and iPhone.
Highly Recommended if you are looking for the convenience of wifi.....beats buying a new camera!"
"OR";"So many reviews that seem to be written by folks expecting a ""magic wand"".  I have three small dogs, the newest of which is a 3 month old puppy. He was a ""biter"": people, things, himself, toys, furniture legs.....  However, the biting of me and the other dogs, seemed to be out of fear.
The other thi"
"OR";"Got 2 of these for myself and my wife and we both love them! Super light, easy to handle, has a keyring hole and bright orange case which makes finding them easy."
"OR";"This is my first Black Diamond lighting device. About the size of a beer can when folded. Bright enough for tent or small room. Lightweight and packable. Works as advertised."
"OR";"Lots of light for where you want it without having to wire a light so the convenience factor puts it high on my list. But it seems very cheaply made so I will see how long it lasts."
"OR";"Makes a lot great bubbles with just one blow. Even my 2 year old can do it.  The only negative is that the blow stick won't hold in the turtle well so if I allow my toddler to use it all by herself she may lose it inside the cup."
"OR";"Bed frame has easy to understand directions and is quick to assemble. Works great and fits twin mattress perfectly. Plenty of room underneath for storage."
"OR";"I'm not sure where the review went that I already left for this product a few days ago. He's a brief re-post. Nice mount, easy install. Needs adjustment for tightening part that mounts directly to monitor."
"OR";"I based my size choice on feedback I'd seen about this product, but it's too small. I'd love to be able to send it back for an exchange, but it may be cost prohibitive to do so."
"OR";"No brainier purchase! Loved Ultra Magnus in the G1 series and always pick up these remakes. Both tuck and bot mode are great. The hammer is awesome as well."
"OR";"Inside the ""book"" is a metal box that locks.  The book flips open to reveal the box, which would be fine, however, the box is quite difficult to open."
"OR";"More than enough air for a 10 gallon.  I'm using it to power an air driven, in-aquarium box filter and am using the included regulator valve to limit the amount of air.
And it's quiet."
"OR";"The water gets HOT on the AZ sun! Too hot during the summer months. But all you have to do is run it a little to cool off. Turning the water off while not rinsing, our whole family of 4 could shower with hot water! We love it."
"OR";"Survival kit and emergency kit in case of disaster.. As of today, I never used it and hope to never use it...
But what's inside is pretty much what you need when you will need it."
"OR";"This was a waste of money. Boring, repetitive, gaps in plot...I was rolling my eyes most of the way through it. I bought it because I thought it would be just as good as Still Missing, but I was sorely disappointed."
"OR";"cheap quality and leaked when we needed it most.  middle of hiking in the Grand Canyon.  spend more and get more.  I learn this lesson the hard way with so many cheaper finds."
"OR";"These voile panels are as stated and a good price.  Specialty store don't have the variety of sizes and colors found on Amazon.  Yes I would recommend them."
"OR";"This is a great product, I used it on my Samsung Google Chromebook because they do not have an ethernet port all I did was plug and play. With this great product you can use it for any type of Netbook which doesn't come with an ethernet port, with this you will have the access that you need when WiF"
"OR";"I loved this book, very informative and helpful, as well. Perfect for a ketogenic dieter, like me! The keto way of eating makes you less hungry."
"OR";"Our beagle has really dry skin in the winter and this product has really given her relief. We have tried everything, but nothing really helped her or they only helped temporarily. After using this for a week she no longer scratches or has dry skin!"
"OR";"The shoes are everything I expect from a pair of Chuck Taylors.  They look good and tend to last a decent amount of time.  For me personally, I get those Dr Sholls inserts to accommodate the lack of arch support."
"OR";"Please note that this is for the single large 3d skull, not the smaller multiple 3d skull mounds. I use this huge one to make sugar skulls, it is sturdy and great for chocolate and sugar sculpture."
"OR";".my older car (6 yrs) loves it.  i find it is now his don't touch me i'm eating food.  my younger cat likrs the chicken chunks meals."
"OR";"Using for porch lights.  Bought the base converters, the candle type, just to use these attractive bulbs where they were needed.  Lights up the front sidewalk perfectly."
"OR";"This are a great cheap way to protect your cards. If you are buying them for Legendary the deck building game I would say: be prepared for them to fit a little loose."
"OR";"Philip Pullman has gone beyond simply re-telling Grimm's fairy tales, he also has researched each tale and provides references.  An interesting and well written book."
"OR";"It's beautiful,  but the waistband is not flexible, my wife could not fit dress over her chest! Buying bigger than your size might work, but it also could be fairly baggy in that case and result in a sloppy look :/ just keep in mind!"
"OR";"Sturdy hammer, great price. Projections of tenderizing face are rather shallow; may not penetrate meat enough to do the job. Handle is not as comfortable as I had hoped. I may wish to exchange the item for a different design."
"OR";"This was an amazing book!  A page Turner from the beginning. There are so many twists and turns to the story,  just like real life!  When you think your world will end... it doesn't...  everything works out, maybe not as you planned. But even better than you could have imaged!"
"OR";"This is part of an alarm system and you need one if you have a garage door.
The plunger needs to be set different,there is no need for it to have to good as far up in the unit as it does.
You have to get it set so it pushes all the way up. There is no lee/way on this.
I got it ok after three tries."
"OR";"This sample was on Fire!!! I love, love, love this book so far. Amina is about her business. I can't wait to read the book in its entirety."
"OR";"Excellent quality, you get what you pay for! Heavy gage steel, the padding is excellent and most of all the fit and finish is 100% spot on.

I really love this machine!"
"OR";"The thing about these is that the hood doesn't leave much room for the dog's neck to move around. It's similar to the idea of actual hoodies for people... some hoodies are loose fitting and comfortable. Others are a bit restraining, such as these. But they are very cute."
"OR";"I realize this series is old news now but I only recently discovered it.  I LOVE IT!  Funny, sassy, thought-provoking, sexy - what more do you need?  I bought the 5-season collection and am thoroughly enjoying it."
"OR";"This is part of the Families War? series. War in the far future with a slightly strange group of heroines. A fast pasted and interesting story. A neat series of technologies that make everything sound possible."
"OR";"looks good, but flimsy. if left on the bike carrier the wind catches it like a sail.
also. came off while riding. don't know when. this one is gone."
"OR";"Works well in Cubase 5.5 on Windows 7, using asio4All as the driver.  Will hickup and drop out until you find the buffer size sweet spot."
"OR";"Shake the walls!!!  This thing is awesome, lotta nice features, super easy to use, and doesn't heat up that much.  I love the sound outta this."
"OR";"Having the circular saw, driver/impact and reciprocating saw, this is no different in quality and battery life when paired with a 4.0amp battery. Boxes keep the tool from getting damaged during travel or at my cabin jobsite. Blade change is simple too."
"OR";"Fat and juicy.  Great for my RES's.  I use these to supplement their diet.  Note, these things don't float, so they are fed these on their basking pad.  This ensures my turtles are eating them and not becoming more junk for the filters to pick up."
"OR";"Great quick read, but I had to use the kindle google option a few times to get some of the jargon. I knew some of the funding terms from my husband's MBA training."
"OR";"I have one of these on a MacBook Pro Retina mid 2012 and it has worked great for more than a year along with Sabrent's 5v power supply.  I bought a second one (with power adapter) to put on a my spouse's 2017 iMac 27 and it caused the Mac to hard crash and need to be unplugged and then plugged back "
"OR";"Interesting concept and this story really needs to be expanded. Too many questions unanswered.

Over all the story was good. True to form with the Madame Eve format.

Loved the interaction with his guy friend. Loved the elevator sexy scene."
"OR";"My dog loves these so much more than nylabones-- I think they're slightly softer to chew apart and don't last quite as long, but my dog hardly touches her nylabones and goes crazy for this toy.  It keeps her occupied for hours."
"OR";"Cuts your wait times by 45 minutes to an hour. Fun to plan your trip and read the hilarious descriptions of rides and the crazy people who do crazy things to ride them."
"OR";"I have read the complete collection of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books so Raising Steam is like visiting old friends. Just like the others, you can turn to nearly any page in the book and it makes you chuckle. It's my kind of humor I guess."
"OR";"This Antec BP500U power supply unit worked great for the Intel D101GGC motherboard I ordered a few months ago.  It's quieter than the Coolmax power supply I was using before."
"OR";"A bit difficult to get into.  Wording seems as though the author has English as a second language. Poor editing.  Mistakes in grammar and misplacement of words.  Eventually grabs you to reach the end."
"OR";"Liked the hero Jay as well as the heroine Sara. Story moved along at a fast and adventurous pace with a sweet love story behind it all."
"OR";"Simply stunning! Another must read. I really can't say anymore than this without giving away the most amazing love story of all time."
"OR";"We enjoy the Crossroads festivals very much. Watch them over and over, enjoy the variety of artists and marvel at how many different styles of music can come from a guitar. I need to get more of these."
"OR";"Arrived in perfect condition. This pan is great..  a nice weight, not at all flimsy like some of the pans I've had in the past.  Can't wait to start using it!"
"OR";"Taylor Caldwell and spouse search in several countries and reviewed over 2000 books. Object was to find as much as possible about St. Luke. Excellent reading for all Catholics and Protesant Denominations"
"OR";"Bought two cans. Dont use on plastic. I purchased this because it was cheaper than the other product I had used before. It sucks, unless you like a crackling dripping mess."
"OR";"I've yet to turn to this kit and not find the bit I need to complete a project. It's got what I need and I love that. I also love knowing that if something did go wrong with a piece, Tekton will stand behind their tools from what I've seen."
"OR";"I had doubts with this set but purchased it based on the other reviews being positive.  I am so happy I did get this, it works great!  The darts actually stick and this is a fun set for kids."
"OR";"Bought refurbished from 6ave. Item is practically brand new, and very clean, also came with the Nikon leaflet. This is a nice versatile lens for carry around, everyday shooting. Here is my first nightscape with this little gem."
"OR";"Perfect!!! Just what we needed for our camper, the old burned out. If we had taken it to the RV place they quoted us $230.00 PLUS Labor to install it...  This price felt like a steal~~~"
"OR";"It is a very nice size and it absorbs very well.  It can even absorb like multiple accidents.  So, so times I just leave it out if only a small part of the pad was used."
"OR";"Story started great, was very interesting with good characters.  But the ending was very abrupt.  Would have liked the characters to have more of a relationship prior to the ending of the story."
"OR";"I purchased this to walk a large cat. Like others have mentioned, it is small. However, I have medium to large hands and I can fit three fingers through the handle. The quality appears high and the mechanism is smooth both in and out. It's a great deal for the price."
"OR";"Fight nice and snug. Plenty of support unlike other minimal shoes out there. Enough actual tread on the bottom so you don't feel every rock. Still very light."
"OR";"Super cute dolls however the arms/hands come off rather easy.  They are supposed to, as in Monster High School doll style, but these are way too easy to pull off.  We lost an arm within an hour of play."
"OR";"A little snug around the calves, but they are cute and relatively comfortable. They're not super high quality, but I think they'll probably last me a season or two."
"OR";"My daughter has a Pig pillow pal that she loves sleeping on but it's getting pretty old and worn out. This unicorn can't be laid on comfortably because of the large tail. She loves how it looks but won't use it. It's also too big to play with so for me, this was a waste of money."
"OR";"The how to book on money laundering.  A long and rich history of how to get rich at the expense of the public. Slick Willie and his bride have mastered the art of political graft and on how to not get prosecuted."
"OR";"Great story but I still felt like there is a lot of unfinished details. I don't know, other than that I like the storyline and the mystery surrounding Natalie's secrets!!!"
"OR";"Dog absolutely LOVES THIS TOY.  Unfortunately, he runs around the house swing it from side to side and beating it off of things. . . . control that element and it's a real dog-pleaser."
"OR";"It is a very nice story. It is funny and loving . Sometime I get mad at men who are so stubborn , but I guess we women are that way sometime to. It is romance and that is what the book is about and it is good."
"OR";"Dream and Bump is the perfect power couple. They are getting it together and Dream is holding shyt sown while still in school. This novel is flowing nonstop and I'm lovin it!"
"OR";"Hardly any filling, my 6lb puppy was essentially sleeping on the ground.. Cheap felt feeling cover. Didn't wash well, and my puppy managed to tear a hole in it and shred it in a month. Would not recommend."
"OR";"Nice case.  Basic black leather feels plastic - gy, stiff, but should provide a strong protection.  Fits my Galaxy Note pro 12.2 with keyboard."
"OR";"Pros: Glasses are comfortable
The lens are very clear a good quality set of sun glasses

Cons: The cushions on the nose rattle a little sometimes annoying

Overall a great set of sun glasses for the price"
"OR";"Once I bought an additional longer screw, additional nut, and a 4mm zip tie for the side near the gears, I finally got it to fit my wife's Schwinn Mountain bike."
"OR";"Yess boo you have done it again it was different than the other books but it was the bomb I love blockka he the s*** but poor Bella can't catch a break I hope her break come in part 2 keep those books coming I haven't missed a book yet"
"OR";"I am happy with this scale. The tare function works as advertised, the unit is attractive and has a small enough footprint that it does not take up unnecessary space. The readout is easy to see and it is totally easy to use. I did a smart thing when I ordered this one!"
"OR";"He is from another time and it's so fun to read how he enjoys all the new age stuff. A great romance! I loved how clean yet hot it could be!"
"OR";"These boots keep my feet dry and safe at the same time (ie. Steel toe). Weather I'm shoveling snow or working in a ditch, I know my feet are dry"
"OR";"Works well with most Z-Wave home automation systems; I'm using this with Vera. The lock itself is solidly constructed and can hold up to a lot of use. The drive system has enough torque to operate the lock when used on ill-fitting doors, hasty installations, or when the door is being pushed while op"
"OR";"Purchased one of these just over a year ago. Was fine for that period of time and suddenly stopped cooling. Company is no help. Three calls, three referrals to service companies, two of which do not work on Avanti, one out of business."
"OR";"I absolutely love this series. The Ravens are the hottest protection force there is. They will do anything to protect and provide for their Fated. Can't wait to start the next book."
"OR";"Lovely story of loyalty, courage and surviving.  I especially liked the authors giving Maggies point of view.  You don't have to be an animal enthusiast to enjoy this book"
"OR";"I only ordered this to fulfill my 25 dollar order. I actually use this thing a couple of times a week. I thought it was going to be junk. Has ratcheting function and spare tips that are included store in the handle. Nice product."
"OR";"This water additive is wonderful. We'be been using it for several months now. Our dog's  and cat's teeth and breath are white and doggie breath is neutralizes now. I'll continue to have a supply in our home."
"OR";"Tip: I know the mouth piece says ""twist"" to open, but you actually just need to pull it out.  I was so frustrated, twisting it and about bursting a blood vessel trying to get water out."
"OR";"Fits my dog perfectly and seems to keep him warm.  Best yet, the dog seems to like it.  Freedom to move yet stays in place."
"OR";"These are still going strong after 3 months of use. I find some solar products fail soon but this has not.
If anything changes I shall update, for now I can suggest these lights!"
"OR";"Love love love this story. I've waited 3 books to find out what happens with Ross and Kyle. And RJ has delivered. With a big win. Awesome story and great set up for the next one. Woohoo. Can't wait for Christmas."
"OR";"I reviewed this on goodreads. Such a cute novel! Wanderlust and love all In one! Loved her style since the famous ""if I stay"". A quick fun and flirty novel."
"OR";"Product delivered on time. The light itself seems satisfactory for taillight duties. The bracket seems cheesy. Very difficult to disconnect the light from the bracket. I give the light itself a 4 star, the bracket a 2 star."
"OR";"If it were the first 5 or six chapters of a book it would be great.  As a stand alone book it is too short, not enough character development.  I don't want to spend $20.00 or more to find out what happens.  $12.00 as a complete series maybe,  but no more."
"OR";"These are awesome chucks....love the bright classic white. I was a little unsure of the sizing, and after some questions and confusion with back and forth e-mails oing to my in-box and/or spam, I got just what I ordered."
"OR";"Sturdy and well built, the jaws would meet nicely except the cutter is what stops them 1/64"" from closing. I will hone down the cutter jaws and it will work well enough."
"OR";"Batteries last longer than I expected, but I ended up connecting up directly to a transformer....no more batteries needed.  Not a bad training device for the beginner, but when you want your game to improve then look at Robo Pong as your next step..."
"OR";"When ordering don't make the mistake I did and confuse the ""radius"" description with diameter. The radius is twice the diameter. If you want a 1/4"" wide bead get a 1/8"" radius bit."
"OR";"Our 9 month old Grandson immediately took to this on Christmas.  The sounds are not loud as some toys, more soothing.  Great for teaching coordination.  Down the line, he'll learn what this is actually for, in the meantime he's playing with it and has not bored as with other toys."
"OR";"I tried using different types of smart charges but it never worked out for me. My N8000 took  forever to charge. This Pwr+ charger has been amazingly fast charger and now my charging time has reduced by 30%."
"OR";"Price was right.  Fit well.  Comfortable.  Not much to get excited about over plain cotton underwear but I still gave it a 5 star rating."
"OR";"These are great units, highly functional for the price paid. Microtik OS is LOADED with features: pseudo wire, VPN, routing, vlan support, wifi in this unit. very happy ."
"OR";"The stitching is horrible!!!!!!!! The one picture I have here shows a small string pointing up. That was the only thing holding it together spend extra money and get something better"
"OR";"Marineland must've moved on to a newer model tank, so I can't get these filters in the pet store anymore. I'm glad I found them for a good price!"
"OR";"Amazing frame! I purchased a 20x30 frame and was worried about what I would get, but it is solidly built and beautiful.  And it came with the proper hardware to hang it, not just a tiny sawtooth piece of junk."
"OR";"Generally, my dog prefers dry dog food to wet dog foot, but she did eat the Pro Plan food when mixed with her dry food.  There is no noticeable odor like with some canned dog food."
"OR";"My daughter loves this. She uses it like a purse and can put it over her shoulder not just carry it with a handle. I like that she has a place to put all the loose poniville ponies and accessories that go with the houses. It came with one pony which is an added bonus for the price."
"OR";"The some the the discs curve a lot more than others.  But the range is really pretty good and it's fairly well made. Very nice action with the magazine and reloads.  But get extra discs, these tend to roll into really good hiding spots."
"OR";"Being i use garlic in almost everything i order this is my favorite kitchen utensil. Makes cutting that garlic so much easier when it gets time consuming"
"OR";"I bought 2 sets, based on another review! These rings are wonderful and provided hours of fun for 5 and 7 yr old granddaughters, racing each other or trying to get through all 6 hoops with one breath!"
"OR";"This is not a professional grade yoga mat, but it's perfect for beginners. It seems like it would eventually start shredding after a lot of use, but still a very nice yoga mat."
"OR";"3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between th"
"OR";"Totally disappointed in this product. Haven't had a good batch of ice cream yet.  The outside freezes but the inside stay soft. And then when you put it into the freezer it turns into ice crystals"
"OR";"I really enjoyed this book.  The depth of characters was amazing, she did an excellent job developing them.  I did not see who the ""bad guy"" was until near the end of the book."
"OR";"Checked at the big box stores and prices for these are way up there. This is by far best price I have found and does a great job of providing great drinking water"
"OR";"It's the right price when you're panicking about a draft, but haven't done any homework on weather stripping. Otherwise, I don't think it actually does much in terms of protecting against cold."
"OR";"Perfect mallet for installing laminate floors. I used this both for hitting the block and installing the transition piece. I read some reviews that there was a rubber odor but I did not find that the case here."
"OR";"The Guardians Trilogy was a decent series. Nora Roberts has a gift of weaving her tales into stories. These are no different. They are a nice break from my usual serious thrillers and suspense. I enjoy Nora Roberts."
"OR";"After reading the other reviews that said these fit small, i ordered one size up. They are too big. I can still wear them for my purpose, but wish they fit better."
"OR";"The size and weight of the pump has me a bit sceptical in terms of it durability. Lets see how it goes. I will report back in 6 months. Great pump for the price."
"OR";"I loved this book!  I usually get tired of post apocalypse stories but this one held my attention until the very end. There were moments in the book I couldn't stand having to wait to find out what happened. but it was well worth reading every single word."
"OR";"I have piriformis syndrome so I a constantly trying to find DVDs that specialize in opening up the hips/piriformis.  I find that I buy DVD after DVD but I keep returning to Bryan Kest's version. The practice makes me sweat AND loosens me up."
"OR";"It's still in the box because I am saving it for a special time to give to my husband. He loves smiley faces so will probably give it to him for Valentines. I really like it so I know he will!"
"OR";"This saddle is so comfortable. Very soft. Keeps my booty comfy. Plus, I have got a royal blue mtn  bike and the white saddle really kind of ""pops."" Many miles this seat is going to see."
"OR";"Product arrived in good condition and my child enjoys using the book. It is a pretty neat learning system and I think the books are pretty informative."
"OR";"One of the best knives I've ever owned.  Stupid sharp out of the box, and love the fact that it not only came with thigh rigging, but also an emergency belt extraction tool.  Both are on my go bag, strapped in my front seat!"
"OR";"Son loved this  great quality, and fit perfectly!  colors were great  and compared to other brand name items it was a great price!"
"OR";"It was great seeing the original version of this movie.  I love the Del Toro remake and the elaborate house it is set in, but there is something really creepy about the original."
"OR";"Its a good book. I enjoyed it, but there's a lot of missing words in the book. It must b something with ebooks. I read a lot, and I'he noticed ebooks have a lot of missing words. All in all tho, this series was a good a good read!"
"OR";"The storyline alternates between primarily two perspectives (a blind French girl and a German orphan boy) and timeframes until everything all comes together as France is being liberated from Germany at the end of WWII.

The prose is beautiful, and really places you the moment. It was particularly in"
"OR";"This is obviously a classic movie, and a favorite of mine for decades. I was sceptical of what Blu-ray could offer, but am dumfounded as to the new life given to this classic. I have never seen this movie like this presentation, and will never watch it any other way again."
"OR";"I wish the music played continually instead of turning off after one song as my son hasn't mastered hitting the button for another song. Regardless, its a good distraction in the car for him and the two volume settings are nice"
"OR";"Fascinating glimpse into the life of a courtesan.  More than I wanted to know.  Much too long in the early narrative.  Mother daughter dynamics very interesting.  Also Chinese men's attitude s and thinking."
"OR";"This was a birthday gift for a 6yo who loves Sonic. When we received them, they were in a plastic bag and looked really cheap...they are small plastic figurines. As much as i thought they were ridiculous, the kid loved them...so I guess if your kid loves sonic, they are great!"
"OR";"I love when I can get lost in a novel like this. I enjoyed the characters and their challenges. I also love when characters grow and develop within a story!"
"OR";"This movie is mean, man ...!!! It was clearly made with the best of intentions: a history about a Secret Society and a young man ( Jackson in his worst performance ever ) trying to get out of it. But the execution of the screenplay is so bad that all is lost..."
"OR";"This tent is huge.  I can stand up inside it and it has enough space to fit 6 people comfortably.  I'm sure you can fit 8 but 6 is probably my max for this tent."
"OR";"My 4 year old daughter loves this cat.  It is super cute, soft and cuddly.  She adores it.

My concern is the stuffed animal is not very full of stuffing and I don't think it is going to hold up well to the hours of cuddling it has ahead of it."
"OR";"The rules are a little complex. Keep the rule manual close (unless you just want to make up a bunch of house rules). But game play is unique almost every time and there is plenty of strategy."
"OR";"My kids ages 5,7,9, and 14 along with myself if I am honest loved this game. It is so cute and amazingly its fun. One of the best games I have bought and I have a bunch."
"OR";"Great purchase.  Made my first pastry shell and pie; pastry shell was perfect. Note, however, that the blender's cleaner is not made to wipe the inner wires."
"OR";"If you have not Read any Michael Lister books you are totally missing out on a excellent Author his writing is very suspenful and thrilling so like I said everybody needs to read the Blood Series ar least by michael Lister and also his other series"
"OR";"That deals with abusive behavior that show how demeaning it is, how lives can be ruined by it but through the grace of God, healing can take place and relationships can be restored.  Great book to read."
"OR";"This is about the coolest alarm I have ever had. My sons hearing impaired girlfriend has one and after looking at it I really wanted one as well. I don't sleep through this one!!"
"OR";"It's hard to tell if these work. I give my dog three tablets, which he takes willingly,  in the morning before I go to work. I don't think it chills him out all day because he's still pretty hyper and anxious in the evenings. He likes them, though!"
"OR";"Beautiful long lasting. With 4 kids we always lose our silverware . My kids think these are ""really expensive "" so they don't throw them away like all the others:)"
"OR";"I bout these for my one year old who wears a 6.5. And these were tooooo big . He likes to wear them around the house though. Hopefully he can fit them before it warms up ."
"OR";"Bought this for my 2003 accord. Although the rack is not ment to fit an accord, it will. I don't think it will fit 3 bikes, but it will fit 2 on the back of the car.
The rack itself is well made and fits solidly when installed."
"OR";"Nice product that will add a lot of production value. Only complaint is that the wheels came with the manufacturing ring still around it. You will need to sand the ""extra"" rubber down"
"OR";"Batterys work great.  Gives a lot more flying time and great price.  The charger is slow and the biggest complaint would be that the lights indicating if a battery is being charged, flicker on and off if you bump the charger.  It does charge them, but could be better."
"OR";"Works perfect with Bose headphones (quiet comfort 3). The cable looks like is good quality and the I love the fact that the 3.5mm connection is a straight connector so it is compatible with my iPhone 6S that has a bulky charging case."
"OR";"I like my fingers at the original length and position. This helps to keep them that way, and the magnetic feature keeps it handy; stuck right to the side of the saw table, next to the face shield and the hearing protectors."
"OR";"The worst finger paint! It's incredibly thick and fairly hard to use. But worse, it's so difficult to wash off and (at least temporarily) stained my daughter's hands! I think highly of M+D in general but they should be embarrassed by this."
"OR";"got it for the kids for a family trip to Hawaii with a planned scuba adventure.
gear worked great... so well the kids are already asking when they can certify."
"OR";"Received this as a gift. My pots and pans have a lip on them and was afraid the clips wouldn't go on, but they did and are very snug. I had to take off 1 star because when I opened it from the box, it had a chemical smell. I washed it, and it still has the smell."
"OR";"Well made, close to center for POI at 100 yards, only issue is you need to screw in the base to turn on and off which is really a simple design.  Recommend."
"OR";"It's lifelike, has good details and good quality. My son loves it, and collected dozens of Schleich animal toys. Great educational toys."
"OR";"Like the other books this involved a element and a Prakenskii. Lexi and Gavriil are broken because of their pasts but come together to make a whole. Five of the brothers and all six sisters come together to beat Lexi's past."
"OR";"The listing said these were 12mm hex, they're more like 14mm hex, vary disappointed seeing how this was the last thing I needed to get my slash back on the road."
"OR";"I bought to for my brother as a Christmas present. He liked it very much. You might want to know that the inside is shiny. That's not a problem for us, but other people might want to know. It is a tad expensive, but that's Columbia."
"OR";"This is the second book I have read by this author and it did not disappoint! Beautiful imagery and sweet but sexy moments make it a story to love! A must read!"
"OR";"Better written than her three previous novels --

My only complaint -- Taylor should not be ex-Army -- Taylor is a Marine.  He's got the improvise, overcome, adapt gene down pat. Hoorah!  Love Taylor!"
"OR";"I watched this movie because Tommy Lee stared and it was filmed in southwest Louisiana.  The movie was just OK.  Acting was fairly good, story line was a step below."
"OR";"The Pencil is a great tool for artists and designers but also for amateurs, kids, and anyone who wants to sketch and draw, cartoon, paint with digital watercolors, or create diagrams easily."
"OR";"This is a strong production filled with beautiful and dramatic singing, and Wixell's playing a dual role tightens the story. Some artistic lapses in the directing are made up for by the exceptional final act."
"OR";"The story starts with a punch and continues to grow in excitement. Sometimes it's hard to tell who are the bad guys. The book as usual is much better than the movie."
"OR";"While looking for something new to read I spotted ""The Pattern Ship"" and found the storyline fascinating. Having completed ""The Pod"", I find myself hungry for more. Please keep them comming Mr."
"OR";"I am not through this book yet but am loving every day that I am in it.  There are jewels on the pages if you look for them.  It is difficult for me to not read ahead.  :)  I want to know what's coming next"
"OR";"Have not got to use them yet due to season not being open however I only use rage broad heads and without a doubt they are the best I've ever used."
"OR";"This was a very nice book to read. I read it to a small group of adult for a literacy project an everyone loves it.

So inconclusion i liked this book."
"OR";"Love the lids for the microwave. They prevent splatter and help keep it clean. Easy to wash. Love the hanging hole - I have them hanging on the inside of a cabinet door."
"OR";"I know I am too weak to do this properly, but I can feel it working out my core and I come away from it with sore abs, which is a nice feeling! I'm not trying to get ripped, just have regular exercise that involves a good variety of things. This is a good addition."
"OR";"Mine came brand new practically. It's so warm with all them put together perfect sleeping bag should last a life time if stored well."
"OR";"Already an invaluable tool. Its stays connected somewhere on my Yun & Linkit projects. Don't use all the modes, although the max-save or peak-hold would be cool. does it do that?, can it? Anyway. Fine product at the right Amazon price."
"OR";"Then, you will love this book! I hate bitter cold temperatures but this book will have you shivering as you read about these magnificent creatures and their mushers. Together, they saved hundreds of lives."
"OR";"The heart rate monitor is only designed to make good contact when it's wet. So I'm not able to wear it all day to monitor continuous HR. This was disappointing as this was the primary reason for ordering. Steps do not seem to be accurate."
"OR";"Likely these are priced to sell the non-metal finished version but these work for us.

The wife is a Diet Cola person , I am more of a root beer kinda guy. Having bottles with two different colors makes it easier to know which is for whom."
"OR";"I liked this book about Molly's adventures in New York. She's very smart and resourceful in solving cases. I'm looking forward to the next book."
"OR";"I love the material. Its so soft and the color is just as the picture . of coarse my husband didn't like it but its really cool and it works great with out room decor!"
"OR";"All around great film great top notch cast Anthony Franciosa really shines so does Carolyn Jones and Dean Martin in a rare dramatic turn."
"OR";"I've watched it countless times. I still sit on the edge and watch every minute of it. It is beautifully done, superbly-acted, excellently directed. Milland is so engaging. Hitchcock was genius."
"OR";"Bought this bag to take on our two week cruise. Seems to be well made and sturdy and I can just throw it in the bottom of the suitcase and it's there to do self service laundry while on the ship."
"OR";"A truly engrossing book, with a unique spin on terrorism. Even though this book is fiction, the story contains quite a few terrifying facts about what is happening in today's world. A very good story of about what's happening in the war against terrorism."
"OR";"I really enjoyed this mystery as everything just fell in place from the start to finish. Of course there was a death to figure out the who dunnit part and then finish with a wedding. It was not a traditional wedding, but a wedding right along. A good read."
"OR";"My second purchase of Flap Happy and I love it.  Super soft, great quality, great price on this one.  Very happy and will purchase more of this brand."
"OR";"Fantastic! Contains all their recipes. Also has the history of how the Salt Lick came about. I have eaten there many times. It is probably a 5 Star BBQ Restaurant in the Austn TX area."
"OR";"These are fantastic! We bought two for our two cats. When we decided to get a puppy, we immediately came back to buy one for him. The quality is amazing. Very durable. They hold up very, very well. The colors are bright and fun. No chipping, no fading, these really are just wonderful."
"OR";"Such a cute and funny story. Love Nicole! Love the  whole series. Makes me miss Christmas' with my mom's family.  She was 1 of 8."
"OR";"OMG, if you are prone to back spasms, DON'T use this!! I was bed ridden for three days on pain killers, muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories after waking up from just one night of sleeping with this!"
"OR";"This rug is GORGEOUS! I've had it for a few weeks but have yet to place it on my kitchen floor.  My kitchen colors are the same as the rug.  It's of good quality; no hidden odors and just nice to look at it."
"OR";"I wish this prequel would've been out before ""Seduce Me,"" part 1.  This prequel gives some of the background on the main characters, Ashley and Brandon, in ""Seduce Me.""  And, includes the reasoning behind the actions taken in the next installment."
"OR";"My dogs love this toy. Unfortunately, one of the pups chewed a hole through one of the corners and most of the yellow fuzz is gone on that side. Aside from that, the toy is still one of the dog's favorites and they love playing toss inside the house with it!"
"OR";"Liquid K9 Glucosamine has been a lifesaver for my St. Bernard mix. She has hip dysplasia, and has been taking this since she was four years old. It is easy to use- I just pour it on her food. It has kept her on her feet for the last seven years."
"OR";"I was surprised Viviane found herself and was able to bounce back from her cheating husband. It didn't take long before her cheating husband found her desirable once more. It took seeing her with another man and her transformation to realize he had a good woman."
"OR";"Great Bluetooth mouse. Never thought it would make much sense because I've had bad experiences with BT mice. Great Microsoft."
"OR";"With growing pains always on the prowl, my daughter can have trouble sleeping at night. Providing the most comfortable environment for her is the key to getting her to drift off to sleep. Toss in an Autism driven sleep disorder and she has had a struggle. Not having to many options to work with I tu"
"OR";"I have not worn this in the water yet so I will need to repost next week.  Love the color!  A little hard to tie the back together, do your yoga stay flexible or have a friend handy.  The bottoms have ties so you can adjust the coverage."
"OR";"Bought this last Christmas for my kids. My kids had a blast playing with it but it only lasted a few months.  Too bad.  It just stopped working.  When I went in to change the batteries they were eroded.  scary."
"OR";"The book was an exhilarating,love story. I enjoyed every word written. It is refreshing to read a great love story contemporary to today's ideals."
"OR";"Super cute lunch box. Sturdy. Only gripe is that it doesn't wash well. Even brushing the exterior with mild soap doesn't seem To help much"
"OR";"Purchased this scope to replace the 4x15 that came with my pellet gun.  For the price, this is a fantastic scope!  The only complaint, is like other reivews:  you can't focus on closer targets when using 7-9x power.  Other than that, I am very very happy with this scope."
"OR";"I enjoyed this book almost as much as the Hannibal Lector series by Thomas Harris.  I was astounded that a new author could push all the right buttons in this psychological thriller. This being the first book in the series I am going to read the next book."
"OR";"This is an easy to search bible.  The Diety is capitalized , so you know when Jesus or God are speaking, the expanded index for a book make it easy to get to your chapter in the bible book.
I highly recommend this book with the translators notes included."
"OR";"It's my first SEP novel... but I could not get into it. 1) This guy is just an ass. I mean... ugh... I was trying to give it a chance but when he humiliated her in front of the crowd it was the nail in the coffin... Jackass from start to finish."
"OR";"When Baruch mini-poodle is bored I put this on the floor. He is happily occupied. Poor friend. He wants to be able to put them back in himself. So I help out and put them in myself. We live on the third floor of a condo."
"OR";"I layered this flooring over top my carpet flooring in the basement for my squat rack, weight tree, and other equipment. Works really well and stays snapped together despite the carpet."
"OR";"open ended clips are bad at holding recently coiled maxline. Go get some copper 3/4 pipe clamps with 2 holes and secure your hose properly. These are too expensive and don't work."
"OR";"Total piece of crap, don't waste your money ! Digits are very small and hard to read. Lock does not open when you set it to 0-0-0 (factory settings) lock is completely worthless. Goes directly into garbage."
"OR";"I bought this set for my 3 year old grandson, he was super excited and the track went together easily.  The cars are okay! one is slow"
"OR";"Nice glass cup!!! This cup would go well with my new kitchen, and new table~and I like tea in the glass cup because I can see the kind of landscape, goods to the Cup outside the kind of mood."
"OR";"I loved this story and I see the reason for the five star rating. This is a wonderful story about finding true love and friendship. I wish that I could give it more than five stars. Buy it, you will not be disappointed with the book. My only complaint is that it's not long enough."
"OR";"I am a diabetic and  I was looking for a comfortable socks that do not bind in the ankles.  I received these socks and love them as they are very comfortable.  They are easy to wash and not too thick to wear.  I will be ordering more in the near future. The price was very good for  the 12 pairs.  I "
"OR";"Eh. The humor was junior high level, the plot has been used before and the characters did not sound realistic at all. It's harmless, though, I just don't think it's worth 3 dollars."
"OR";"Love the color and texture
Ive order towels to match color in shower curtain 3 times and theyve been either hot piink or horrible texture."
"OR";"I purchased his for my son.  It was a little larger than expected.  Even for an adult head.  Color is bright yellow.  The Mohawk kept its shape all night long."
"OR";"Great feature in that you can move the arm to another place with the second sleeve that can be put on a second wall.  Put one sleeve in my kitchen and one by my TV in my livingroom - avoids having to buy two in order to have a stand in both places."
"OR";"Switched to this recently and we're in the process of mixing it with her old food. But she digs her nose around trying to get these like bits first before her old nuggets lol"
"OR";"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the adva"
"OR";"The title states Cooking from the Pantry, but she gives a grocery list and some recipes to make from that list. Not what I was looking for or expected from the title. I'll look at it again and try a recipe, I'll try to anyway."
"OR";"I actually LOVED it when it worked. Unfortunately it quit after two months of occasional use. I didn't use it every day but probably 10 times in a two month period and then it just quit. It wouldn't do anything at all. Very disappointing."
"OR";"These are a great reusable tee and sure as heck beat the crappy wooden ones that break and fly all over the course.

I strike the ball much better with these and I truly believe they work. They've definitely improved my drives."
"OR";"Perfect for our dramatic play area. The kids like to give the stuffed toys check ups, and we took the stethoscope to put last doctors appointment."
"OR";"I love this serie !
It keeps going nicely and the plots are great !
A bit to longish time to time, but a really good read !"
"OR";"...or any of the other 'slim' Powershot pocket-sized cameras that are the same size.

It fits in snugly and provides great protection. The case is well padded.

The carabiner on the one we received is elongated rather than round as shown in the picture here. It comes off if you don't want it on ther"
"OR";"Great read!  I couldn't put this down, and I can't to read the next one.  The author knows what he's doing and his writing shows that he has a mastery of the language."
"OR";"This product title makes it sound like this is a genuine 3M part, but I see absolutely no evidence that it is. Might have paid a premium price for a generic product."
"OR";"Don't need to say too much about this movie almost sure everyone has seen it at one time or another.  An it does bring back memories for me.  Hope it does the same for you"
"OR";"Raunchy book intended for genre fans. There's more substance than you usually get in this type of story and the writing is good. Overall, this is a quality release."
"OR";"This case has a nice feel, but is rather bulky and does not protect it from falls.  As I learned the hard way, dropping your iPad on one of the corners using this case will cause the screen to shatter.  This offers no real protection to your iPad."
"OR";"Worked very well on my Festool track. Cut beautifully and works as expected. Less than Festool OEM version. Not much else I could say about it."
"OR";"This gel isn't really a stain, it goes on more like gloppy paint, it brushes on easily and doesn't drip or run, but it doesn't penetrate the wood like a stain does. The Honey Maple color is very orange."
"OR";"I love this camera and all of it's many features.  Don't buy the kit lens. It is not worth the extra money.  I put a C. Zeiss 24-70mm lens on it and it is wonderful."
"OR";"My German Shepherds love this as a starter in their food bowls.  The quality can't be beat and the sourcing is reliable and trustworthy.  Worth its weight in gold.  I use this more as a food supplement rather than a primary food source."
"OR";"I need to select different scenes to show; for a college class that I teach- I was STUNNED to discover neither of these discs HAS a menu! I'm really upset. I have to see if I can return them, as they are NOT gonna work for me."
"OR";"Godawful, don't waste your time!! Gave it one star because there are no -1.
Purchased at Red Box for a buck twenty eight and would like a refund."
"OR";"4.5 Star Review
Kylie Wilson was in love with Marcus Stone until he abruptly left two years ago to pursue a career in snow skiing.  She stayed close to his twin brother Malcolm and over the last year, they spoke less and less about Marcus during their weekly phone calls.  One day Kylie received an i"
"OR";"Simply the best cop show ever. Period. Caruso and Franz had such a great chemistry. It's a shame Caruso left after the first season. Franz won multiple Emmy's I believe. Great cast. Great plots."
"OR";"SMOKE and agent Sidney are a great team who are beginning to trust one another. At least Agent Sidney is beginning to show a romantic Interest in SMOKE. I like them as a team. But who and what is SMOKE. Read On."
"OR";"Got the hat for my dad for Father's day, after he opened it it drew laughs from everyone in the room, he absolutely loves it and the hat is a hit! A great buy!"
"OR";"This is a very powerful movie. I have never been a big fan of Jim Carrey, but in this movie he is great and plays the character with much sensitivity apart from humor. Apparently the movie was never a big success in the US, which could be because the subject is too close for comfort.

It brings to m"
"OR";"Our black lab had stomach issues with every other food we tried until we found Taste of the Wild. We have switched between multiple flavors with no I'll effects. I won't buy anything else now."
"OR";"Simple with an easy explanation style, this book offers old pros and new owners an opening pass to the battle that is puppy training. But I think, if you stick to this book, you have a much more positive chance of winning the war."
"OR";"Los Lonely Boys had one or two radio hits when they started out and are included here. Excellent musicians who strut their stuff in a live setting without being pretentious. Not too may ""Texican"" artists out there, so pick this up and enjoy."
"OR";"Super cool. We got all 3 & my boys and husband have a blast. The dump basin is too high for the other 2 to really dump into without help of hands but its still fun."
"OR";"Fit m22 and walther ppx. Only problem is mag for ppx won't fit in mag pouch. But the m22 mag fits great. Now if I can only buy a second mag for my m22!"
"OR";"Love this! I have it in my motor home. We travel extensively and I am on a No Bottled Water kick. It is perfect to make sure we have good drinking water wherever we go."
"OR";"Marguerite and Renata are each on their own quest, and the storyline brings them together nicely. The setting is gorgeous and the plot is enticing without being predictable. This is a good book to take out to your hammock with you!"
"OR";"Thought I would wear this as a tunic, but it looks great as a little summer dress. Wish it came in more colors, cuz I would get more."
"OR";"I put these collars on my 2 cats that were looking sideways at each other.  After putting them on each cat, I had hoped they would calm themselves down.  It seemed to me that they got worse after I put the collars on them.  Didn't make sense to me so, I don't think they really did the trick."
"OR";"The material is a bit lighter weight than I expected, even being labeled light weight. Which means it doesn't quite hang as shown in the photo. I purchased burgundy, and it's lighter in color (a bit more pink) than the photo shows."
"OR";"Good I gave it for because I don't think the steel on then in side is as strong as the out side gear  or I just got one made on a friday lol but my old stock one was till good so I swaped the gears out still I will buy a nother one"
"OR";"These are much better than the Uniden OEM batteries. Having 1400mAh makes a world of difference. My portable Uniden phones last much longer off the base chargers."
"OR";"We have been so excited to test out our new kite since it arrived a few days ago.  The weather finally cooperated today, and we were able to take it out for a test run.  First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, co"
"OR";"I found this book to be very readable and informative.  I originally thought the book wouldn't be an interesting read, I was wrong.  The writing style kept me on the edge of my chair!"
"OR";"Originally payed close to $20 , so its somewhat disappointing to see how much the price fell considering its a larger Pop. Good for anyone planning to buy today. Still an awesome buy to complete the Guardians set."
"OR";"Very effective training harness. ""Puller"" gets redirected at the end of the leash and learns to slow down. My only frustration is that he adjusters on the harness do slip if your dog is an aggressive puller and will need to be readjusted often."
"OR";"This strong, light-weight ladder is a big improvement over any of the ladders of its size that I've used before. The tray in the rail at the top is extremely handy for small items -- why don't all ladders have them?"
"OR";"Unlike ""Gone Girl"" the packaging was exactly as you'd expect a better dvd to be in.  Also the movie is brilliant and I have absolutely no negative comment to make about this movie and how Amazon sent it to me in the mail.  Regards,  Naomi  (Martin)"
"OR";"Most products don't wow me - this one does. It works EXACTLY how it is advertised. It literally took 2 minutes to clean the litterbox and that includes the litter mess the cat left on the floor (he's an jerk - not the product's fault)."
"OR";"love this shear, i bought this to clean the face of my maltese/shitzu puppy  the tip of the shear is round so you don't have any poking accidents its also very sharp the only thing is the hole to place your fingers is a bit snug but overall a great buy"
"OR";"Love, love.  The color is so pretty and really like the full zipper front.  Would certainly buy it again and do love the length."
"OR";"It constantly kept me guessing. Not the sort of book I read, but I read the other two based on a recommendation of a person I trust.
The last book was more about the less central characters and sacrifice as well as the love triangle.
Would absolutely recommend this trilogy."
"OR";"Suburb quality.  Fits in my Instant Pot Duo 6 quart pressure cooker.  Use it for many different things besides baking.  Cleans up effortlessly."
"OR";"They fit very tight, so had to get a size larger.  Otherwise, very nice shoes and a good price considering some of the alternatives.  My hope is they will stretch out a bit too."
"OR";"Fast paced, believable plot line with some comical relief thrown in. If you are squeamish, you may not like some of the story lines but I find the overall reading experience to be entertaining."
"OR";"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review. I really enjoyed reading about Spencer, the bad boy that is taking the blame for his brother to avoid royal scandal. There is alot of drama and steamy scenes. I recommend this book!"
"OR";"Love the story  I needed more at the end
Great writer.  Good character development. I'm going back to get more info about Chris"
"OR";"i mix it into a small amount of wet food, and it's spared me the dreaded vet visits.
has been a huge success, for the cats.  saved me $$$$$$$$$$, and the
stress of packing up the girls in a crate to go to that ""place"""
"OR";"A well made bra, sturdy, no wire.  Holds its shape beautifully after gentle washes.  It is one of my favorite bras.  Converts to cross back easily."
"OR";"Awful soap dispenser. I would give it no stars if I could. The bottom is screwed on. Plus it leaked from both the bottom and the top where the seam is. I had to throw it away. Complete waste of money."
"OR";"My cat is so picky. This she loves! Please remember this IS AN APPETIZER! She will eat this and will still be hungry. It is good for when she won't eat her regular food. I give her this food first thing in the morning and she is usually back to eat in one hour."
"OR";"Fits and looks good. Practical and offers additional protection. Versatile. Get it you won't be sorry !  The youngins will be very happy, happy, happy, to have one !"
"OR";"We did a major remodel and chose this style of handle. It looks classy and functions smoothly. It has a sturdy fel to it when you grip it to open the door. Both the look and the functionality get 5stars!"
"OR";"LOL, I just picked this up at BJ's for $6. 00. Used it and was pleased with product. Only negative is the shape of the container - too big for my microwave so it doesn't turn on the turner, but just as well. pasta came out perfect. No more cleaning pots and strainers."
"OR";"Ordered these for our pumpkin party.  We put them in the pumpkins after the kids carved them.  Worked great!!! The price was good too!  Will be looking g for these again next year!"
"OR";"This should be, how to survive on an alien planet when your attacked, with no hope of rescue. Ensign Stone, now Governor Stone and his band of Marines, head on out into trouble doing what they do best.
Not as good as the first or third in this series, but still an excellent read"
"OR";"I use to have a Big Blue filter, and struggled changing filters every few months.  Then I had one crack on me. Fortunally I was home.  I bought this to replace it.  I love the ease of changing filters and the peace of mind that it is a metal housing."
"OR";"My dog loves this ball and it's scent. He went after it the second it was out of the packaging. Holds food, but it isn't challenging because it's open on both ends, so instead I slide his bully sticks into it to make them a little easier to hold. The nubs seem to work well for that, too."
"OR";"I had my friend get this boombox because he almost got into a 2 year contract that would have cost him over $600. Ifound this on Amazon for him and it works great!"
"OR";"This toy has been awesome for my dog who is the definition of an aggressive chewer. He had the toy for over a year and only yesterday did I have to throw out of toy because it finally broke. It could withstand long distance throws and lots of chewing. The squeaker in it held up well too."
"OR";"A great size and shape and it is nice to have the tray option.  The yellow is lighter than expected, more of a lemon color, but a nice bright pop of color in the dark basement."
"OR";"Great toy, but its HUGE! My boxer cant pick up the large. I would have definitely gone for the medium knowing how long it is (large is more than an arms length)"
"OR";"We have a very stubborn almost 2 year old lab/boxer mix that loves to pull on walks. This calmed her down instantly. She's no longer combatively pulling when we walk her and she does great! Took some getting used to for her, but this works like a charm."
"OR";"Nice material, but isn't all that practical to me. I reverted back to squashing garlic with my knife to peel and manually chopping it. Other times I just use my food processor for bulk garlic and mason jar storage."
"OR";"Mine stays true to its size, but the red color on the print is duller than it is in the picture. The material is pretty thin. I'll update if it wears off after a few times of washing."
"OR";"This battery allows me to shoot all day without worrying about how much juice I have left. This kind of peace of mind is priceless. A professional battery for professional photographers that gets the job done."
"OR";"This was required reading for an undergraduate history class about Espionage at UT of Knoxville. It was the first novel about spying written in 1903, and it is well worth the read. Very interesting."
"OR";"OMG. These headphones are amazing, they have wonderful noise cancellation and wonderful bass/vibration aspects. Would refer to friends and purchase more. I have always loved skull candy audio."
"OR";"this is the second book in the series and its just as delightful as the first... if you love the young adult genre but also love fairytales, this one will definitely be up your alley.  The characters are fun, the story will keep you engaged and the drawings at the beginning of each chapter are just "
"OR";"Made of solid wood, with a cutting board style top, this cart was a little smaller than I expected, but the quality was better than I expected. It's solid. There is some assembly required - about 45 minutes worth. Given the price, not a bad deal at all."
"OR";"A short story from Hugh Howey, do I need to say anything else? Sure, it's 99 cents for a single short story, but it's Hugh Howey and since so many of his books are under priced, just spend the buck and enjoy the story."
"OR";"Mixup leads to erotic awakening and love...what a great read!  I love how Claire Thompson's women are strong and self sufficient.  Submission from strength is incredibly erotic."
"OR";"After using this for the past year or so, some if the clips are starting fall off kind of easily.  No big deal, just push it right back on the rope.  For the price, it's definitely worth it.  Great for display if you don't plan on taking your hats on and off of it much."
"OR";"Don't bother buying this.  I purchased it to locate exactly the places my cat had sprayed so I could treat the correct places and this light did nothing!  Don't bother buying it."
"OR";"But the base will tend to tip forward unless you securely position it so the fan's motor creates a stable center of gravity. Other than that, this fan delivers a nice blast of air, considering its small size."
"OR";"The packaging looked interesting and we needed some extra light on our RV patio.  The lights arrived and just as I suspected.  Cheap...Cheap....Cheap.

Quickly ordered new rope lights from Camping World.  Now we are happy campers.

Pass up this one...."
"OR";"I love this series.  Keeps getting better and better.  Love the action, the comedy, the love scenes.... Everything!!!!  Keep them coming, please!"
"OR";"Heavier and bigger than I expected. It ended up taking too much space in my small bathroom. And the chrome paint somehow look pretty cheap. Already returned it."
"OR";"Bianca Sommerland never disappoints.  Danger and hot steamy guys and their exploits are a win. How one girl can get two guys to change for her are just plain tough and sexy."
"OR";"The PS2 connection from my mouse did not fit all the way into this adapter.  The adapter nor the mouse were recognized by the computer.  However, seeing as it was shipped from China, the adapter arrived well within the time frame indicated."
"OR";"Interesting twist for some matches.  Disappointed in plot for undertaker and haven't really seen Brock Lesnar since.  Leonard does not have the charisma of Taker so my hope is the intent is not to have him as a replacement draw.  He will have the longevity of such a character as the Undertaker."
"OR";"My favorite pair of summer shoes. I love them so much. I don't want to put anything else on my feet. The yoga mat soles are the best. winning."
"OR";"I feel like it's overpriced for what you get. It is nice to get everything in one package but I was able to find plates of the same quality at the dollar store."
"OR";"This product was specifically recommended for our old cat who was a bit anemic.  Once she was on this, that was no longer the case!  It doesn't have a dropper included, however (thus, not a five star rating) so you have to find a way to get it into the pet.  But it worked wonders for us."
"OR";"I'm hooked on the Dresden series.  I have been concerned that the books are going to become repetitive or predictable, but so far Butcher has kept them fresh and equally entertaining, and Harry's character and his relationships evolve.  This one might be my favorite."
"OR";"These are great. They are a bit smaller than I imagined, but they're the size of real measuring spoons so I should have known. They are great and look really nice on the counter!! Also came in perfect condition. I have the bowls and measuring cups to match and couldn't be more pleased with all."
"OR";"Gives a background into Logan's first meeting with Hanna and how he became the man he is today and why he spent so much time searching for Hanna. Well worth the read."
"OR";"Another awesome story by RJ Lewis ! I fell in love with the characters, the love Heath and Allie have is beautifully written.  I love how the story unfolds and you really have no idea what is going to happen just like all of RJ' s books it was unpredictable and oh so good!"
"OR";"In terms of color and contrast, this is the best lens I have for my Sony A6000. My Sigma 30 2.8 lens is close to this Rokinon. I love the effective 18mm angle and highly recommend it, especially given the modest price."
"OR";"Replaces the thin plastic seat that came with our Santa Rosa Kohler toilet. I'm very happy with the comfort and strength as I sometimes have to use it as a step stool for the upper cabinet."
"OR";"I bought these with the intention of using them in my Dremel tool (not actually a Dremel but a craftsman type Dremel). But they won't work in it because the shaft is too small and the collet won't tighten up enough to secure the shaft to it."
"OR";"This is the second story of this series and I really liked the way the author extended the characters in this one.  Also, the way she expanded the Naval academy and all the events surrounding the characters.  Of course l loved Jack, haha, who wouldn't!!!"
"OR";"I bought this to upgrade my slow running work laptop. The speed of this ssd is awesome. My laptop now runs perfectly even with only 4Gb of ram running Windows 7."
"OR";"You ever get sick of having to pay top dollar for a rechargeable battery? I know I do. But that is the reality and I am not willing to have to buy a whole new drill rig because it seem more economically feasible to do so instead of buying a battery that is about half the cost.

Well with this Pwr+ s"
"OR";"If talking dragons with attitude interest you, you will enjoy this book.  I got hooked on the character of Temeraire, the dragon who is very intelligent and concerned about the conditions under which all dragons have to live.  The writing was not always the best, but I liked it enough to buy all the"
"OR";"Im a lifter and I keep a chalk ball in my bag. I use this religiously when I deadlift. Great for keeping my chalk. I also get compliments on it all the time."
"OR";"My daughter and I watched this movie 4 times in a row before taking it out of the player. I loved the story, Shows what can happen when you work together and believe."
"OR";"At first when I started this book and after the first few chapters or so I was BORED. I really wanted to switch to another book because I thought this would be makeup related. The book picked up right after that though and I am very glad I read it. I'm buying Messy next!!"
"OR";"Trina M. Lee's books have a way of drawing you into the story. This one was no exception. It has action, a bit of romance, and even some mystery. I enjoyed this book and know you will too."
"OR";"This book was crazy, it was a fast read although I was really getting angry with the editing of this book .......hope part 2 is much better"
"OR";"Another great read from this author. The last book in this series. A stand alone book. Good characters and story line."
"OR";"Bags look and feel great,  just got then today, they will be put to the test tomorrow, hopefully they will last a long time, by the looks of them they should do very well."
"OR";"DUDE. I think this is such a great steal for a knife like this. It came sharp, holds a nice edge, I love that it came with a lanyard, and the design is pretty freakin' sweet, as well. No regrets, I am happy I bought this as I am a collector of blades. It's a must have."
"OR";"I ordered the wrong size so I had to give it to my niece. it runs small. order up. but this dress is soft and fits so smoothly on your body. I will order the next size up."
"OR";"Great basket. Like others have said you'll want to devote the handles when you're riding, so the basket doesn't pop off when you go over a bump. I found that medium sized binder clips do the job perfectly."
"OR";"This is advertised good and safe for rats. However, 47 of my 50 rats had serious eye problems. Itchy, redness, inflammation, and even red tears. I would never buy this product for my rats again."
"OR";"This toy was shipped in a timely fashion with no damage. It is a well made product for a very good price compared to department stores! Very happy with my purchase as are my kiddos!"
"OR";"I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this"
"OR";"Helps to keep my Jaybird Bluebuds in ear without the wings, works great, hold up long, don't get too nasty and i just wipe off on shirt if they come out with a friend (sorry gross but it doesn't look dirty afterwards)"
"OR";"Oscar, enough said. I won't ruin ending, but you will find your self leaning closer to the tv every 10 to 15 mins figuring out will they make it in the end."
"OR";"This was used in a daycare to secure a small fridge to the wall to avoid tipping onto a child. Straps work very well and is well worth the money."
"OR";"This sci-fi story details the recurring story line of mans in humane treatment of its brethren, its desire to explore and discover, plus its faith in the future.  It is an interesting idea of what would happen if we had to start over from the beginning."
"OR";"I actually did not know that Rodan was a color film since it was that long ago since I've seen it. Loved watching these classic Kaiju movies."
"OR";"I previously had a hook type toilet paper holder which kept coming loose in the wall. This is a easy lift bar to change out the roll. Looks great too."
"OR";"Very good book.  Took me awhile, started in for the second time and never put it down...unbelievably realistic, this could actually happen. Didn't' see it coming, never would have it would end they it did. This is one you really need to read."
"OR";"I didn't know I needed this until I got one, and now I don't know how I went without it. Such a simple tool that makes working on the front end much easier - not to mention cleaning the front wheel! Works perfectly and the price is right."
"OR";"Very low air flow - 13cfm
$10 to return - not worth it.
Awkward shape.
Light can't be turned off.
Airspeed knob is pointless since airflow is always low."
"OR";"This is the final (so far) installment of the Riyria Revelations series and culminates in a surprising and fun ending.  Michael Sullivan is a terrific writer and I hope to read more of his stuff in the near future."
"OR";"This 300W heater is about 1/3 the price of a similar heater at my local fish store.  I would highly recommend it as it is doing an excellent job of keeping my aquarium at the desired temperature."
"OR";"I thought this would be a perfect keep at work filtered water solution yet the space the filter takes up makes this somewhat clunky tumbler's capacity limited to 26 oz and as such need of frequent refilling."
"OR";"Great product for the price, I would recommend sizing up when you order. I'm a size 10 and half an inch more and my foot would be off of the sole."
"OR";"Love these shoes.  I had an ankle injury that keeps me from wearing shoes that come up around my heel.  These are very comfortable.  I've bern wearing them for several weeks."
"OR";"Very nice guest set of napkins. Well stitched. Nicer than what one might find at many restaurants, and certainly better than the paper version!"
"OR";"A good story that moves right along. Entertaining and a commentary on black, white and gray decision making.  I especially liked the ending as it was satisfying, but unexpected."
"OR";"nice that you can separate it into two units.  I used the 4 only, not enough room on my receiver for the full six.  Secured it with a heavy duty double stick Velcro pad."
"OR";"Great story about changing your life for the better!  This is a total different character set from Hustle Me, so reading order doesn't matter.  Many tears, lots of laughs, and the desire to kill the soon to be ex husband!  And now a bit about the story....

Ramsey has lost his family to a horrible a"
"OR";"It has a lovely rose scent that is not overpowering.  The bag in my opinion is strong enough and it holds quite a bit. I also like that it doesn't come with a plastic dispenser."
"OR";"Neither my 3yo or 1yo seemed particularly interested in these ones, although I have the other set, which I put in the bath, and they really like playing w/ the magnets in the bath."
"OR";"Hey, what else can you say? They're great poop bags. Have had no problems whatsoever. Cheap enough to hand out to the jerks who don't bother to carry bags and leave nasty landmines throughout the neighborhood."
"OR";"Love it! Flying helicopters are so much fun. My cat loves it too. I attach a little string and a toy to it and fly it around the room for my kitty to chase."
"OR";"I just received this so we are on day one, but so far my dog LOVES it. He hasn't been interested in any non-edible chew toy I've given him but he is absolutely loving this."
"OR";"I was just a little disappointed with this story but then it turned to the better as the hero changed his mind. I would still recommend this story to those who love historical romance."
"OR";"This is a wonderful flash for my Olympus OMD5 - small and powerful, just like the camera... and the ability to tilt the flash as well as regulate it's intensity makes it a real asset to any photographer."
"OR";"I received this paperback on loan from a friend. I really enjoyed this second book of the series-- much better than the first which sometimes mired me down in world-building. Red Plague offered another great plot and I continued to enjoy the friendships between each of the characters."
"OR";"When it happened, I remember a blip in the news about this story. This book filled in details--I learned about a whole world of cartography.  Sometimes slow reading, but I learned about maps, crimes, collectors, library security."
"OR";"It changed my mind on it not being a real tool! Wow we used it camping and I was impressed. We had a flash rain and even used the spike to dig a flow trench around the shelter."
"OR";"Purchased many times and like these - they finally got rid of the cloth underside to the sandal which helps with the stinky foot smell that happened with the old design!"
"OR";"Bought this movie on a whim because a friend was always talking about how great it is. I had it on for MAYBE 30 minutes and shut it off.  I've never put it in my DVD player again.  I just wasn't into it!"
"OR";"Not sure what to review, they are exactly what they say they are.  Work with the sharpmaker.  One end is marked red (I assume to tell between the ultra fine and the other stone which is white (fine)."
"OR";"Look great under the cabinet. With the wires were white or another lights color. Hard to hard on white cabinets. Pretty sure black cabinets are not ""in style""."
"OR";"It fits the hatchet blade but had to pop out one of the bottle rivits to open up the hole for the handle to go in,then stitch up the remainder of the part that i had to pop off the rivit."
"OR";"This little unit pulled me out of a pinch after a failing USB Boot drive. Installed the old hard drive in a couple minutes, booted right up and ran my installer from this. Worked like a charm, was cheap too on price."
"OR";"My Yorkie loves his wee wee tray and, thank heavens, knows how to use it!  The top clips onto the base and secures the pad which prevents liquid from leaking off the edge.  This is a must have item."
"OR";"This is a good idea IF your saw motor is sealed or set outside the bag. It will catch most large wood dust but it is a pain to set up and take off in order to dump."
"OR";"I love this stuff.  I suppose the scent is a matter of personal preference, but I like it. It smells like natural essential oils to me.  I keep a jar by the cat litter box, and it does a nice job absorbing/controlling odors in the area."
"OR";"Ordered large.  Received a medium.  Shirt is not as long as portrayed in pic.  I am 5'6"" and want to wear with leggings.  Don't think I would be able to pull it off."
"OR";"I paid little so didn't expect much. Fun at first but didn't take long before it broke. My daughter would loose interest in it quickly."
"OR";"Yes, one of mine was delivered with the hole sewn shut in the inside. Took a razor knife and opened it, no problem. Filled the bags with rice. Took about 20 pounds."
"OR";"The travel bed is perfect for on the go pets.  I keep 2 of these in my office for my pup...because they are so portable, it just makes life easier for all.  Very soft and washes well."
"OR";"This painter's tape has a strong stick. This is good once you have it on the wall, but it makes it challenging to unroll it. If I was not pulling really evenly as I unrolled the tape, it split off and tore. It did not leave any residue when I removed it."
"OR";"The picture depicts a metal like hook, but it is all clear plastic, the hook part slips onto the support brace that is mounted to the wall, perhaps with it being plastic, it may not rust..."
"OR";"I bought this to organize and clear up space in my garage. Its sturdy and didn't take too much time to setup. No more clutter around the garage. I'd buy more of these for organization."
"OR";"It's hard to tell from the picture but the mount is made of sturdy metal. They're very well made. I ordered multiple sizes and am very pleased with them all. Fast shipping too."
"OR";"i think Maniac MaGee was one of the best books i have ever read. i thkn this, because i think this book has a good message about racism.i also think it was really emotional and has a good plot to it. i recomend this book to anyone who likes a good story."
"OR";"Fascinating read. The authors take their time and examine the back story with sensitivity and thoroughness that extends to the victims, the perps, and the small New England town and its environs in which the crime took place. Really enjoyed this one."
"OR";"One of our top rated games ever and we have two large gaming cabinets. We have found this is well liked by all ages, easy to learn and play, and overall a great game. Ages that have enjoyed it in our home range from 6-55."
"OR";"Likes: Adding/removing the pound increments is easy and simple with very little effort.
Dislikes: Sweat collects between the weights and the skin when the weights are worn directly on the skin. The fit is a little awkward because I have small writs and ankles."
"OR";"The book starts out grabbing your interest right away. You won't want to put it down for essential things like meals or going to bed. Enjoy it It."
"OR";"The mat is soft and nice. It is not plush as it suggests in in the description. This might work better for smaller dogs but my 78 pound labradoodle needs more cushion."
"OR";"First of all if you are looking for a clean recency novel, pass this one up. 2nd although I really liked the plot, it was lost in the morass of passionate kissing and longing for one another that began about half way through. Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of pass"
"OR";"It's a small toy but my dog appreciated his! It didn't last too long but my dog really appreciates his toys in the means that he completely destroys them piece by piece."
"OR";"Seagull 1x-2x Right Angle Finder for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Minolta, Fuji, Olympus and Leica SLR cameras is very high quality and it obtains very good image quality.
I recommend this product for DSLRs."
"OR";"Used this to replace a sensor that had gone bad on a Heath Zenith outdoor light. Works perfectly as described. The dual-bright function is a great feature."
"OR";"These things are just great-- after buying a few, I stocked up and always keep some on hand. Great for quick and dirty lights, or can be used in more durable installations w/ covers and such. These aren't indestructible, but they're tough enough and good brightness for twilight."
"OR";"Puppy loves this donkey. She's a bit aggressive with it. I've had to stitch part of the neck back up. The sound box works great. No sign of her being able to remove it. I would buy this again if he meets his demise since he's her favorite."
"OR";"Great product!  My dogs love, love, love these, and they're made in the USA so no worries about plastic in the product.  Have ordered before and will order again."
"OR";"My niece loved this gift!! Great price for a present and Perfect for a creative 11 year old!! I cant wait to buy more styles!"
"OR";"Asian sized, so definitely order 2 sizes larger than you would normally purchase.  If wear XL normally and they don't have one big enough for me.  Nice quality as expected and gave to my girlfriend who is 1/2 my size and it's perfect for her."
"OR";"Angelina is a writes an etiquette column for a newspaper and Benedict is an earl trying to improve his family's finances with an invention.  They had known each other years ago and find themselves at the same country houseparty for the holidays."
"OR";"Been a Koontz fan for a long time, but his stories have changed over time.  Breathless could hardly be labeled a thriller, or even suspense.  I like his characters, but this one left me kind of disappointed.  I enjoy when he adds the dogs to his stories, tho."
"OR";"Great flashlight, plenty of light for house clearing and any other use you can think of. Battery wares well and charges timely. I would buy again"
"OR";"I moved into a new house that had been built about a year before.  For the past 17 months I have been changing batteries very often in my three CO detectors.  I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent a"
"OR";"I just received this dress and it is absolutely adorable! I love the flower petals on the bottom. I plan on purchasing a petticoat underneath as I believe it will look much better."
"OR";"Only cat Food my cat likes. She used to like the gravy fancy feast,  but now she won't touch them. Doesn't even lick the gravy. I've found that she never gets bored with the chicken fancy feast."
"OR";"Excellent. Finally a good drama and suspense movie with English speaking actors! Usually I watch foreign films( in my personal experience, they're better than typical Hollywood films). But this film was very good. Thank you."
"OR";"I am 66 years old, and I LOVE this movie!  Very inspirational in so many ways, and beautifully drawn, directed, acted, and executed.  A good watch for any age."
"OR";"This is one of the very best leashes I've ever bought. When we need to hurry this is great! I would buy this again and I would recommend it to everyone who asked"
"OR";"I purchased this tablecloth to use on Easter.  I removed it from the packaging and washed it in cold water on the ""hand wash"" cycle and dryed it on low.  It came out completely unusable.  It was full of snags, runs and wrinkles."
"OR";"My 2 year old loves these dolls so I got her this one. The headband is horrid. I figured it would come off, but it is sewn to her head and the bow is totally lopsided. I would have returned it immediately, but once she saw it, she wouldn't let me so now we are stuck with it."
"OR";"Absolutely lovely dress,will order other colours. It is a wash and wear dress with no ironing necessary. The colours are vibrant, the fabric falls nicely. It is a lovely dress that can transition from work to date."
"OR";"Besides&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Doubtfire-Blu-ray/dp/B00RNTYI3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs Doubtfire [Blu-ray</a>] this is probably Robin Williams best works. I was so happy to finally have it on Blu-Ray. I have fond memories of watching it "
"OR";"I found Torchwood Series 2 to be thoroughly enjoyable.  Once again, the show manages to balance very real tragedy with a sense of fun and hope; something that was not achieved in the subsequent Children of Earth miniseries."
"OR";"I purchased this for new furniture that will be delivered later this week.  I am used to leather but this time purchased microfiber. Was worried about the dog getting on the recliner and getting it dirty.  Will post a later review on how it works out once furniture is delivered."
"OR";"The hood is almost too tight to fit for example one of the BT color lights. My LED phone-controlled light show bulb is too large for this lamp."
"OR";"This product is great, the light is a soft blue tone. It doesn't hurt your eyes when you wake up in the middle of the night. You can angle the fins on the night light, so the light is not all over the place. And as soon as Amazon has more in stock ill be getting a few more."
"OR";"It seems that all of JP boos start off slow and he didn't disappoint in this one either. The meat of the book was good but the ending was slow and painful to finish."
"OR";"How would you feel if you were discounted as having little or no value because of a disability over which you had no control. Enjoyed this story and especially the knowledge that everyone eventually becomes disabled through age or accident."
"OR";"Lights arrived promptly and were exactly what I wanted.  The quality appears to be top notch with a heavy duty materials used.  Lights are nice a bright, but not too bright to drive your neighbors crazy.  So far so good.  Time will tell."
"OR";"I've had rubber ice trays before and liked them a lot, but these are a bit smaller. I like these but sometimes I have to get more cubes to get the right chill for my drink. Other than that these are great. Of course they don't brake, and the cubes of ice come out differently."
"OR";"These work amazing under my recliner.  I placed 2 at the front and 2 at the back under the recliner and so far so good.  I haven't had to reposition the recliner because it is hitting the wall.  My recliner sits on carpet.  Problem solved!  Happy customer!"
"OR";"It's hard to love a sheet set, but I do like it. It fit perfectly and the color was great. It was well made and I would recommend the product."
"OR";"It just gets better and better I can't get enough! I can't wait to see what happens next as Juicy continues her crazy life endeavor."
"OR";"I bought this book a few years back, and recently gave it to my grandfather as a gift. He read it (and loved it) so he gave it to a friend who then ordered two copies for his friends. Then I took this new copy I bought and gave it as a gift, so now I have to buy my third copy!"
"OR";"Unlike the taller socks, these don't feel as tight on my ankles .  The tight weave promises durability as does the lifetime guarantee against wearing them out .
  I also like Smartwool and Bridgedale socks  ."
"OR";"It is a book about persuasion. People don't want to lose. Imitation from others is the key to influence. The author said 95% of people are imitators and 5% are initiatiors."
"OR";"These are gorgeous rings, a definite bargain for the price.  I ordered them for a silent auction for a fundraiser for the National MS Society & they were a hit. I hated to let them go. I am purchasing another set for myself."
"OR";"Comes disassembled, every piece is separated. After I have assembled it feels very loosely and chip.
I have returned it, don't want to break the screws when gonna to use it."
"OR";"This is not one of her better stories. The storyline was choppy and abrupt at times and there were multiple editing errors. I have enjoyed her stories so far and will try again but this was fell flat for me."
"OR";"The book was filled withmystery, intrigue, love, romance,action and characters who kept each other on their toes. Thank you for a most interesting and enjoyable couple of hours reading."
"OR";"Somewhat slow and rambling in the beginning.  Too much information about the growing up years, his associates,, and the neighborhood.  The years after his childhood were more interesting and kept my interest more.  I think the writer could have done with much less detail."
"OR";"PAIN IN THE BUTT. None of the attachments seem to thread into the two sizes of cleaning rods without an adapter. I truly detest this thing as I cannot justify buying something else after spending money on this, I live with it."
"OR";"This is for Valentines for my wife. After taking out of package it looks Goood but will try to remember to update after valentines. OK after valentines it definetly looks goood and doesn't need removed to fulfill the mood it sets."
"OR";"This movie is one of Anthony Hopkins best performances!! This movie will make you THINK about how life really is in aspects that we normally avoid simply because it's just too painful. It makes me wonder about hospice in a way that I have never thought about it before and I am rethinking its methods"
"OR";"The N scale campers are doing fine camped along side the river in my N scale coffee table layout. Woodland scenic makes nice quality figures."
"OR";"This is a great quality light duty rain suit. Comfortable to wear, packs small, doesn't look goofy. Sized very generously."
"OR";"really nice case.  We purchased a chromebook for my 5 1/2 and 7 year old daughters and they love the color.  It holds the tablet and cord well and even has Velcro to connect the handles.  Very happy with the purchase; reasonably priced too."
"OR";"I really like these little boats. They clip together by a little post on each boat- one into the next forming a train. They float well in the tub, keep my daughter entertained and most importantly drain well to prevent mold."
"OR";"Exactly as described! This mat fit our 16x16 artwork perfectly and works wonderfully with this frame:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049OAQ48/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8

Together, both of these products saved us hundreds over custom framing!"
"OR";"I give it 3 stars because the Barbie and the two animals are great, I'd give them 5 stars, but you're buying this as a package and the other stuff is not very good."
"OR";"Posting was misleading in that it stated it to be 8' long and didn't mention the stretchable to part. Thought I was getting a fixed length 8' but it still works OK all the same."
"OR";"Very solid, nice, clean looking napkin holder.  Matches most Satin Nickel finishes.  Very pleased with this product.  Price is good for the product you will receive."
"OR";"This cord is great hands down works great looks great I use them for my beats by dre so it makes the phones look custom."
"OR";"Works great as a mount in my car. I drive a Ford Focus 2012 SEL, and this mount works perfect to mount a camera or a phone above my GPS screen."
"OR";"I was ill when the concert happened. It came as a surprise to me on cable tv a few weeks ago.  Missing the first half made me research the concert music and DVD.  I bought both and am glad I did.  this is more than a concert that was videotaped."
"OR";"High quality stainless faucet at a great price. I purchased this to replace the faucet in the kitchen of the house I rent. It functions well and was easy to install."
"OR";"This thermostat worked great at first but soon crapped out. This is the second digital thermometer that I have tried this grilling season with both failing. I have since ordered the old school analog thermometer. I have had these last for years. Live and learn."
"OR";"Unfortunately the articulation makes the figure's top half look a little freakish.  But If that doesn't bother you, you get a lot of playability and displayability with that articulation."
"OR";"Never could get this thing to work right. I hook it up to all the right connections; but get no response on the monitor. It has been added to my dust bin of useless parts."
"OR";"I used this to install a new crank set. This is big enough to allow me to get some torque on it to secure the external bearing BB. I didn't experience any slippage when torquing it down, but I can say if a person is not careful it could slip."
"OR";"Whoever designed this product to prevent bed rollers from sliding deserves a substantial credit -- and hopefully cash. They really fit the rollers, protect a wood floor and keep the bed from sliding."
"OR";"this is my 7th pair of Jambu shoes size 9.  These fit like 9-1/2 and I have to wear socks to keep my feet from slipping out of the shoes.  So I am disappointed."
"OR";"As other reviewers mentioned, sometimes you have to hit the on button a few times for all the lights to turn on or the off button a few times for them all to turn off.  But I couldn't expect much more for the price.  My son loved turning them on and off in our 4th of July decorations.  Excited to us"
"OR";"Mark Cole has more tech stuff than James Bond, more karate moves than Jackie Chan and more lives than a cat.  This book is action packed from the beginning. A very surprise ending"
"OR";"I really wanted to see this.  The first one is one of my favorites.  But it just was not as good.  I dunno.  Can't give you much more without spoiling the movie."
"OR";"If you have a Promaster XC tripod, you're probably purchasing this because you need a replacement or you'd like a second for convenience.  I fall into the latter, and this has worked great."
"OR";"This is a good algae scraper - but much narrower than I was expecting.  Would love this exact item but 3.5 or 4"" wide instead of less than 2""."
"OR";"Flimsy, JUNK, hardly a  Panacea, Not nearly worth the money.
Has the worst assembly instructions I have ever seen,  omitting information as how to sequence the pieces
so as not to require disassemble to position the parts properly."
"OR";"I had sharpening stones for years but do to moving several times, I've lost them. I love this sharpening system because it has three grades of stone in one small package."
"OR";"The Easter bunny brought this for my 4 year old daughter!  She LOVES IT!!! She totally thinks it's the real deal. The items are sturdy, far beyond dollar store play makeup plastic. The perfect gift for my daughter."
"OR";"This play set is fantastic! It is beautifully made and so detailed! There are quite a lot of small, loose pieces that will be a bit tough to keep up with. My 3 year old is having a great time with it. She loves the moving elevator and astronaut and robot figures."
"OR";"Fits perfect, clip is stout and difficult just to pop on, but stays put. I thread mine on as I put my belt on. Breaking in slowly but very good quality."
"OR";"Ker has knocked it out of the park with the final part of this series. I have so loved following the journey of Ryan!!!
This one has not failed to amaze me again. I know I will reread the whole of this series again and again."
"OR";"I give the Hotel sheets to my daughter
She likes the color, feel of the fabric, the fit on her bed (mattress set)
It was and is the best choice I made thanks"
"OR";"I purchased these to make chocolates for my son's most recent birthday party. These molds are well made and it is very easy to get candy out of them once it sets. They wash up nicely."
"OR";"I just finished this. I have always been fascinated by the Ice Age era. As an avid hunter and outdoors-man, I noticed a few things that didn't seem plausible- not enough to detract from the story. Just started the 2nd of the series, hope it is as good as the first."
"OR";"Booties appear to be well made. As cooperative as my dog was through all my multiple attempts to get the booties on his x-small furry feet, it was challenging and took time. He did his best hip-hop dance moves until he realized they weren't coming off."
"OR";"1, 2, & 3 were far better.
The thing is that ""Hunter"" is introduced here but to the little boy, as a neighbour.
The scenes do keep you at the edge of your seat, nail-biting scenes, causes goosebumps - but it was not as gripping as the first 3!"
"OR";"We use these to get the cat's poops out of the house ASAP.  Love these bags because not only do they  smell good, but they have a handle which makes it easy to scoop and throw away.  Also the box is good to sit next to the litter box, grab and go."
"OR";"My daughter loves it.  Keeping track of the accessories can be a bit of a pain.  This doll has gone swimming in small yard pools, chlorinated pools, and has been played with extensively."
"OR";"This was my first Heidi Hutchinson book. I really enjoyed it and plan to read more of her work. The only issue that I really had was the characters age verses their maturity. I would've thought that they were in their late teens, early twenties at the oldest...but otherwise a good read."
"OR";"This is a great over shirt for a plain onsie. It doesn't look like a dress and my son wears it a lot. It's double sided so it makes for a nice bib and you can turn it around and not have to look at any mess that's made too far from a change of clothes."
"OR";"For the price, these little tips work well for me. They will break if you put on the patch first and try to push it down the barrel. They usually last me a couple of years, and I clean my rifles and pistol 10-12 times a year. I would purchase this product again."
"OR";"I have a kindle and read all the books in this series except for Demon Angel, which is not on kindle.  I love this series.  I found it clever, sexy and intelligent.  Except for the author's annoying habit of over using names in conversation, I felt they were very well written.  So I decided I would "
"OR";"This book was very hard to take in, considering the subject matter.  The 'experiments' conducted on people of color, prisoners and the poor, highlights why there is so much distrust of the medical profession and our government."
"OR";"Been running strong for 2 years now, quieter than my last one, and definitely more power.  More affordable than anything in the big box stores of this size as well."
"OR";"I think I bought fake shoes. The insole is rubbed
up in the second day. However, I was told the insole cannot be changed. What should I say?

I have to sort the insole by hand when the insole rubbed up to make me comfortable."
"OR";"Have only played with it so far.
The RPM dial,
# 1 position doesn't work
# 2 barely turns
Though I can't see a need for such low RPM."
"OR";"Great toilet. clean lines, Works great. it is not oversized and it does not project too far into the room which concerned me because we have a small bathroom in a 1951 house."
"OR";"This was the stupidest short story I've ever read. It's like the author just started writing every idea and rambled about it while making sex scenes."
"OR";"These are really cute and the color combinations are great. I can't wait till it gets colder out so I can wear them. They are a little more bulky than plain cotton socks."
"OR";"Very comfortable, can be worn all day. I like that the cross strap attaches with velcro, making it easy to get the right fit with various weight socks."
"OR";"It didn't get buzz cause i think people thought it would be a blah romantic comedy nope very adult an warranted of its R rating and i think hilarious"
"OR";"These are a smaller sized, hard bone. The dog likes them. I like that they have a sort ingredient list and that the company does extensive testing on all of their products. You can even go to their website, enter your product batch numbers and see the results of all the testing."
"OR";"So Im 5'7 175lbs and I bought this jacket in a large. I absolutely love it just fit a little too small for me. I have long arms and a long torso. Im keeping the jacket but switching to a bigger size. The style is so cute and I love the hood."
"OR";"DVD arrived in excellent condition as far as packaging.  The quality of the dvd was excellent.  Item arrived way before the shipping deadline.
Would purchase from this seller again."
"OR";"I've had nothing but trouble with this GPS since I replaced a Garmin unit that died shortly after it's 1 year birthday (conveniently just out of warranty).
The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the u"
"OR";"Because I started using a paper pellet litter, I purchased this scoop due to the wider holes and it is great. I especially appreciate the ability to hang the scoop on the side of the box."
"OR";"This is a great combo. Can't say enough about how well this works. Can cook 2 different items at once. Make chili and cornbread at the same time."
"OR";"If you spin it too fast, the medicine tend to fall over.  Slightly higher dividers would help greatly with this.

Love that it has partitions - one for me, one for my husband, one for my son, one for common.

I have it it a corner cabinet as shown, and it fits great."
"OR";"I have three cats and finding something that was safe and gentle was very important. This product was great for their sensitive skin and smelled pleasant too which is always a plus. I will be ordering some very soon."
"OR";"Couldn't put it down. Again I can't believe we treated people so horribly. After reading this book I believe even more in treating people the way you want to be treated."
"OR";"This was a really good short story about Jordan and Aric.  Jordan was getting nervous about having a big wedding and Aric did something that was so sweet for Jordan.  Jordan has to deal with her past, but she is so good about it and puts everything into perspective."
"OR";"Long time needed product that replaced a regular mitt. I have no problem holding pans fresh out the oven but that does not mean they're burn resistant obviously."
"OR";"Another great, high quality rug I own from Norcho. I love this company! They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rugs are a beautiful addition to our home. We received this awesome animal zoo print one and have places it beside our little girl, Giselle's bed! She has be"
"OR";"I like everything about this clock. I like the illumination, I like the look of it, and I really like the alarm that gets louder and louder as it sounds. If you are looking for an alarm clock that you don't have to wind up, look no further. It's a Seiko and that has come to mean dependable to me."
"OR";"I've seen this movie when it first came out, few years ago ! I loved it ever since.such a perfect movie and music !!! Such an inspiring story !"
"OR";"My dog doesn't like dog food but he loves Fruitables. The nice thing is you can read all of the ingredients (natural), and they smell like cookies."
"OR";"No-nonsense SATA interface. Plug-and-play. It doesn't work on full-sized, 3.5"" spinners, but that is to be expected. 3.5"" spinners usually require additional power. For SSDs and older laptop drives, this is wonderful!"
"OR";"Don't we all just want to love poop bags lol. They are poop bags and hold the poo just like they were supposed to. the holder isn't so bad either.
If they picked up the poo for me I'd give 'em 5 stars."
"OR";"piece of crap- 2nd set- this time the teeth collapsed just by hand grip pressure - no cranking down on the lock-- these vice- grips are complete trash. 1 STAR IS WAY -WAY TOO GOOD A RATING"
"OR";"I hunt a lot and that means you shower a lot.  Regular scentless soap beats my hair up and makes it dry.  DDW shampoo and conditioner helps keep dry scalp in check and is still scentless."
"OR";"I was not 100% sure that these would fit my 25 year old 14 inch ASMAC bandsaw, which I think was made in Taiwan.  Well, the part hasn't changed at all in 25 years, and it's a perfect match.  Very happy with this buy."
"OR";"Good purchase, good seller, anything all right. The toy are new and at perfect state, the only weak point is the short period of battery's lifetime."
"OR";"The kiddo loves this, we love this. It has turned into a tradition- we read the book and watch the movie. Wholesome, moral, entertaining, great animation."
"OR";"Easy to install, comfortable and stable wide grip, larger plate makes keeping router flat on the workpiece easier. Very happy with purchase."
"OR";"I loved the characters, she was feisty and oh so smart mouthed ... Could have done without the bad language. Never understand why we need to use the ""f"" word however the book was fast paced and action packed."
"OR";"The performances were fine, but stunted. A lot was cut out of the story. After seeing the version with Tom Hardy it is impossible to see Heathcliff as anyone else. That version was incredible. This is, eh."
"OR";"It's ok... I didn't realize it wasn't ratcheting, if you have a 100 pound grip, you'll do fine, After my 10th cut in 3/4"" CPVC, I was done with this tool... I'll stick with the ratcheting style."
"OR";"They are so cute! I get a lot of compliments.  Make sure to squeeze them onto your ear so they stay in place. At times I'll get one that slips off."
"OR";"They're hex wrenches.  Good length for torque. Ball end for those bolts that you need to get a little angle on.  Lots of sizes.  I got these and the matching metric set and tossed all the odd one-off's I had in my tool bag."
"OR";"Wow! I have to admit this book took me by surprise. I have had a book hangover for a few days since reading it. It's kinda like I'm obsessed by it. It was easy to read and flowed easily. But, the subject matter was a little hard at times, and a little spicy too. I found myself wanting to yell at the"
"OR";"This faucet was easy to install and looks great. Our old faucet was leaking and just looked old, this one works great, love it."
"OR";"These are nice and look fantastic.  If I were buying them again I would choose something in the same wood but with some checkering.  They're too smooth & slick so I'm readjusting my grip a lot between shots.

I bought for a project P226 restoration so I was going after 'pretty' over practicality."
"OR";"Excellent Product I purchase it with a promotional code from the seller. I recommend the product is super good quality and is as described. It came in perfect conditions and it shipped fast.

If I have to buy again I buy it without concerns because is super useful and looks perfect."
"OR";"Pull the capsule apart and add to a tablespoon of moist food and your older cat will act like a younger kitty. The pain relief provided is worth the cost."
"OR";"What a horrible product.  Horrible!  Why would someone sell a product without a valve for inflation?  That is correct.  No valve.  No way to put air in it--it does contain air so it can leak out; and, it does."
"OR";"Debating returning this dress. I sized one size UP to size small. I normally wear a size 0 or extra small in Ann Taylor or Bebe.  The size small is just absolutely perfect. The dress is extremely gorgeous.  I'm 5 foot two and the height of it is just in the middle of my knee. So it really has it vin"
"OR";"Came well packaged and undamaged. It does need 3 D-cell batteries, which do not come with it but no big deal. I like how the trash bag can be hidden so all you see is the trash can itself, which looks really nice. It is nice and big and the sensor works well."
"OR";"Have 2 Camera batteries as backup.. the switch does seem a little cheap but it will get the job done.  Very Bright light that doesnt spread the beam too wide."
"OR";"This book reminded me of my college days which were many years ago but remain fondly in my memories.  With a salute to social media, the author presents a loveable scoundrel who entertains one page after page.  Nicely done."
"OR";"I received these with the stitching coming off of one of the straps. If I pulled it, the rest would probably unravel, so they got sent back. They felt comfortable. I'd ordered W width, and it was too wide - I might have been able to fit the M width."
"OR";"Squeaky when you sit down. The fabric rubs on the bars. My wife suggested using candle wax on the bars and that worked great. Can't have a squeaky seat in a hunting blind."
"OR";"I had seen this on tv years ago, but forgot how funny Rowan Atkinson is in this. If you've ever seen him in anything else (Blackadder, Mr. Bean) you'll want to add disc this to your collection."
"OR";"Preggers Jessica
Then there's a zombieland Marc
Is Sinklair the book?

It took me one week
To finish Betsy's sad book
I'm still crying tears

Laura is now bad
I'm tired of the same stuff
Why am I still here?"
"OR";"This movie made me hate this character. What a terrible sequel, with gawdawful writing. I seriously despise Liam's psychotic character now, who was so wonderful in the first film."
"OR";"This was one of the best gifts we got our daughter this year.  She absolutely loves this!  We have already taken this table to numerous relatives houses because it keeps my daughter (16 months) distracted and entertained.  The storage area is great and set up is simple."

GREAT QUALITY. nice finish good and solid item feels and l"
"OR";"I really wanted to love these IEMs, but I can't.

I was immediately impressed by the packaging. These buds came in the neatest, most functional little white box, kind of like the EarPod cases that double as carrying cases. But the EQ on these are awful. They're marketed as bass-heavy IEMs but that m"
"OR";"I've been using this camera for about a month after a long-desired upgrade from my older digicam.  Wow what a difference. Great size, easy to handle.  Superb images."
"OR";"My mistake - yet another one where I didn't realize it was a PREVIEW ONLY, not the whole book.  It didn't tempt me enough to purchase the real book either."
"OR";"Someone obviously used this for a photoshoot then returned it to Amazon. Since I bought it at a great discount from the warehouse, I could care less since it's 100% functional."
"OR";"Hard to top this Engel for keeping minnow alive. I had it in my shop and kept minnows alive for over a month but changing off half the water every week. I now have a 30 I plan to use to hold my bait and use this one on the boats."
"OR";"This is exactly what I needed for all of my shoes. The assembly of the unit was obvious and straight forward. No instructions were necessary though they were provided. I assembled with the leveling feet, which allow for the unit to withstand a greater load. Works perfectly for my needs."
"OR";"It's definitely a full cape, which is awesome!  It's nice quality and is perfect for my costume!  The purple lining is a little more plum than what the picture shows, but that's not a problem to me."
"OR";"I got this for St. Patties day. I've lost weight and it was too big for me now but the size was correct. It's kind of made from hoodie material so it feels nice too."
"OR";"I saw this on TV and decided to get it to show the family every Thanksgiving.  It has great acting and it is very realistic in it's approach to the journey to America.  I will show it at school as well."
"OR";"This feeder works well at keeping the shells in and not all over the place.  However when birdie bird flys around in the cage, they blow out anyway.  Its still a good feeder."
"OR";"The straw is almost impossible to suck any water through, but I guess if you're going to be using it for drinking lake or river water it needs to be a good filter.  I use the bottle without the straw and it works just fine as a bottle."
"OR";"Very fun but not durable at all.  Falls apart and breaks easily.  We don't play with it long because there isn't much to it but the people are fun to play on our other play sets and the kids enjoy using the launcher.  Definitely not worth full price."
"OR";"The sound is amazing but I can't really make them stay inside my ear, and I've tried all included sizes of the rubber. If you move the cable it ""rubs"" and you can hear it."
"OR";"These are Great! The battery lasts pretty much forever. Sound is excellent, noise cancellation is phenomenal! Range could be better but it's right on par with any competing headphones, I've just been spoiled by the old Motorola S11's."
"OR";"My baby is 9 months old and LOVES this toy. She loves opening the lid and pulling the toys out. They are the perfect size to fit in her hands."
"OR";"I really liked this mail order bride book. It was a nice clean romance book. I would recommend this book to all my family and friends"
"OR";"Ben Bridges combines the hardships of pioneers with good guys and bad guys. What more do you need for a good tale of the early West series? Excellent read."
"OR";"Great moments.  Breathtaking Cinematography.  Deviates from historical accuracy about 2/3 of the way through in the cause of storytelling which I can forgive but the story was... average.  (Spoiler). Grizzly bear attack was awesome.  Some explicitness (rape)."
"OR";"Product is at least one size smaller than stated, if not more, will update if they break in well. But as for now I'm going to try to get feeling back in my big toe. made for a poor shift. Even a short one (5 hours)"
"OR";"I bought the biggest one and can't hardly zip it up. The tight fit may be good for warmth but if you're one inch taller or wider than me forget it! I should've sent it back but it'll work in a pinch so I kept it."
"OR";"This Ted Higuera and Chris series was fun!  It started out a little slow to establish background, but picks up speed and finishes with a flourish. I think the reader will like it."
"OR";"This towel is great! We took it with us during a long trip and they performed as claimed. I loved that they are not bulky st all and dry really quick. These are my go-to towels when I go to the beach now."
"OR";"Purchased to help make the switch from sippy cups to glass glasses for little ones. These are FANTASTIC. I love them and am even using them myself when I take a drink to go in the car. Wish they came in grown up styles. hint hint."
"OR";"Notice the wood handle is previously fitted then separated from its own utensil. Align each handle back into its own utensil and pound it in to wedge it. Season the handle several times with wood or mineral oil. Perfect."
"OR";"Great purchase
Bought this one because the office pull boxes were painful.
This bag is nicely constructed, nice compartments, and even distribution of weight. The wheels roll smoothly. It's not high society style, but perfect for my needs."
"OR";"I just love this table, so so so so easy to set up, no real tools required. Holds weight with ease I sit on this table constantly (110 lbs) and everyone rests their feet on the shelf, it flexes but hardly and so far no issues."
"OR";"This might be good for reading by the pool, but the lenses are a little small to work effectively as sunglasses in most other situations.  However, my mild disappointment with this specific pair would not stop me from buying a different pair from this manufacturer and vendor."
"OR";"Very soft and warm.  Washed up beautifully; hardly any lint in the dryer filter. Nice size - not too big but not too small.  Liked so much that I bought two more."
"OR";"These shoes are lightweight yet provide a more dressy look. I can wear them for long periods of time and walk comfortably. I would recommend them for women who are trying to wear more heels but don't want the discomfort of a v-shaped front shoe."
"OR";"These are strictly for water aerobics. For that purpose that have a nice snug fit. I did have to take the liner out to improve the fit, but the surface underneath is fine for water walking/running. Do not think they would be comfortable for other purposes unless I exchanged for a larger size."
"OR";"Both cats go crazy-happy when I groom them with this brush, and it removes A LOT of loose hairs with each brushing. It really is easy to clean, too, and I haven't had to deal with a hairball in months."
"OR";"I use this for the beach, it's great. Packs small and absorbent, washes well, nice color, it even comes with its own pouch, what's not to like."
"OR";"This is not the same Denziel Washington Safe House. The Denzial Washington Safe House was a really exciting film. This one was mediocre, although there wasn't really anything wrong with it technical wise."
"OR";"Colors are very nice and quality seems acceptable.
Only complaint is wiring colours, should you choose to hard wire.
I mean if 89.7% of sales are to US/NA, why NOT Green, Black, White?"
"OR";"I LOVE these socks!  Just right to keep warm in lower level of house!  Note - these are a VERY DARK PURPLE.....Bordeaux had me expecting deep red....but I much prefer the purple!"
"OR";"I enjoyed this book it was a softer version of the other books in this series but was so good one of my favorites it had the action but most of all you felt the love the family had for each other in this book."
"OR";"Construction quality is adequate, fit is adequate, product not impressive. As a lady that occasionally buys man-clothes, it is always hit or miss. This one was closer to a miss."
"OR";"I got these for my father who needs wide shoes. Well, I was hoping these fit him because some of the reviews stated they ran small. I was happy when they fit perfectly."
"OR";"This tale is very disappointing. Although Le Carr is much touted as an insider to the international intelligence community, his stories can be written by any author that reads the newspapers. Ed Spievack, author of ""Memoirs of an Unfinished Generation."
"OR";"Fascinating update on Joanna Russ' world populated only by women. Feels real, no nonsense, great world-bulding. A little humorless. But otherwise terrific story-telling."
"OR";"Great acting!!!  Would definitely recommend this movie. Can see why it was nominated for academy
Interesting drama and history of HIV /AIDS and how far we have come"
"OR";"i wanted these to work but the wide size was still not wide enough and the strap that goes around your heal is way too long. the sole of the sandal is incredibly comfortable and i love that it is completely black, but the sandal is so loose it falls right off."
"OR";"As a driver and a rider, I don't think there is a more effective way to make yourself seen.
This set is very inexpensive and as good quality as I could expect for the price."
"OR";"It works out of the box. I was happy for a while until I pause the music and notice the massive static white noise this device is generating in the background. Then I disconnected the receiver from my speaker. My speaker is quiet again. I was hoping for better and returned it soon."
"OR";"Interesting book.  Lots of excitement, adventure, trust, courage, and attraction make this an good read.  It has a lot of what makes a good book."
"OR";"this is a very boring film and very predictable.this film was done a year before this one came out.this film is The White Waiting To Exhale.pure formula.you'd swear Puff Daddy was the director?"
"OR";"Brandon the 3rd brother finds a mate in Maggie. Mating is rough and the Penn wolves are still fighting Marcus pack -great follow up book"
"OR";"Made in China, but then what isn't? The ratchet design is not like my other Craftsman wrenches.
OK for the money. Works OK, too. Something is rusting on the inside and leaking out of the ratchet head."
"OR";"This is a high quality surge protector for a reasonable price. I trust the APC brand above many other brands, and the high quality of this unit is very apparent when compared with cheaper surge protectors."
"OR";"As long as they don't lose any files from my weddings I love them. I have never lost files from a wedding so I worry when I purchase new CF cards. So far so good."
"OR";"How would our lives change if we miss a pliant or an appointment, or we sleep over or get up on time?  Some micro seconds make a difference in someone's life and changes everything. Is that destiny or chance. And afterwards that's it really matters"
"OR";"I bought two of these and I really like them; better yet my dogs like them.  I take them hunting and they stack well and hold up in cold weather."
"OR";"Devastated from a career ending injury, Ben can't stand what his life has become.  Single mom, Caitlyn can't imagine anyone wanting her.  Can these two hurting people come to terms with their lives?"
"OR";"My husband loved these gloves!  He said they were light, fit perfectly snug and was great shooting gloves.  Best he's ever worn."
"OR";"They didn't work.  Sent back for a full refund.  We could see ourselves in the screen, but no sound, and couldn't see the other person.  Super disappointing on Christmas morning."
"OR";"These Quickstrips are perfect for throwing an extra 6 rounds each in your pocket.  The rounds come out of the strip smoothly and works as described.  The traditional speedloaders while providing a faster reload, are much more difficult to carry around."
"OR";"I love this very different take on a Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory idea.  I loved the constantly changing character perspective, I loved the story, and I loved the character growth."
"OR";"This is a film I was expecting to love, but unfortunately it couldn't hold my interest. The story seemed weak and dragged on. Someone else might really enjoy it."
"OR";"awesome lightweight compact great for pretty much any size camp stove. Folded it out a lot larger than I thought it would. Pleasantly surprised.."
"OR";"Absolutely totally captivating story!!! Jack and Abi are truly relatable characters! I can't get enough of these characters they seem so real and was laughing and gasping all through this book!! I cannot wait for more this series with just the first book is 100X better than FSOG!!"
"OR";"I bought this hat for my husband who has a tendency towards basil cell carcinoma. This hat protects his head and face from the sun and yet is lightweight and comfortable. He looks as if he is on safari."
"OR";"I got the 15ft cable but mine does not charge as fast. I had purchased the 6ft white cable from here before and it works great but I needed a longer cable and not satisfied. "
"OR";"The stylus precision tip is very very flimsy. FYI, these styluses will not work with HP ENVY or other touch sensitive screens. So far, the only thing these worked for are my phone and tablets.

Hope this review helps with your purchase decisions."
"OR";"Outstanding book. Really, opened my mind up as to what I should be focusing on in retaining customers and recurring revenue from a core group of customers. This will help me build a business that will be sustainable, predictable and sellable. Liked his book, Built to Sell."
"OR";"Ok I figured it out but the instructions need improvement for something this complicated just a diagram with letters when wood isn't lettered is a fail. I will probaly buy again as I know how to do it now and for me is what I need a few of these for reasons."
"OR";"When in comes to DEET, there is no such thing as better or worse brands. It's all the same chemical, so shop for best price AND compare concentration of DEET in product you're buying. I recommend this product because it is highly concentrated at 98% so it should last a long time between applications"
"OR";"Works, with a little indecision on my home panel- useful there.

On my son's panel- inserting the transmitter trips the arc fault breakers (which I believe are becoming standard and required in many residential installations)! No use at all there!"
"OR";"Very cute doll.  The animals respond clearing when facing necklace.  It seems to be well made.  I bought it for my 6 year old grand daughter."
"OR";"Just what I expected. Nothing fancy, but enough room for the essentials. Sure, you could pay more, but if you are only an occasional kegler like myself, this is perfect for lugging your ball and shoes to the lanes."
"OR";"I bought this for my daughter for Easter and she still loves it! It's just the right size and it's really cute and easy for her to grab on to, she's 6 months old now."
"OR";"I have used literally thousands of discs of various brands and I have found these PHILLIPS discs to be extremely reliable. I've recorded a dozen different file formats and could not be more satisfied."
"OR";"this highchair I perfect. was easy to put together and was the best Christmas gift my granddaughters received. The are nice heavy wood chairs. also arrived quickly and appreciate the service I received. LOVED LOVED LOVED the highchairs."
"OR";"I am a big man at 6'2 tall. This hoodie is made for someone who is big and short. The hoodie doesn't come down past my waist I'll never wear it. It's trash. This is a true embarrassment to the Dickie's name brand."
"OR";"I love readin this author and the story telling is great but I really wanted more Christmas stories but still gave it a five star rating."
"OR";"The Pledge was great. It was very graphic. Sean Penns 3rddirecting job is outstanding since the similiar one ""THE CROSSINGGUARD"".  Jack Nicholson does a perfect job in this role."
"OR";"Pretty but not functional. Fabric is too light and it doesn't stay in place whatsoever no matter how often you adjust it. Give it 3-stars due to the description being accurate and loving the color"
"OR";"Too big for my 18lb dog. I thought that she might be able to bite onto the furry thingies, but there's not much to hold onto. Only recommend it for large breeds."
"OR";"it must just be kids. My son loved it for two days...its funny how kids give you a really good guilt trip to get them something then after you get them the thing they want the most, then find out in less than the time it takes to deliver it, they lose interested."
"OR";"These are cute and my kids were excited about the color choices but we purchased two pairs and both hurt the kids' ears. They refuse to wear them anymore and we had to replace them with a different brand."
"OR";"Pretty swim dress but not at all practical for swimming.  It could be okay if you don't plan to swim laps.  Fabric seemed very heavy and cups, although formed, did not offer adequate support."
"OR";"This is on our ""Top 25"" movie list.  Superbly acted, written, edited, filmed, etc.  Sound is terrific too.  That's meaningful because of the . . . well, you just have to see it for yourself.  Twice."
"OR";"Another great DJ RObb read and addition to her collection.  Nora just keeps on spinning award winning novels that draw us in and entertain us."
"OR";"Great for wiping fingerprint smudges from my iPhone and iPad.  I've used this with or without LCD cleaner and it always does a good job.  Highly recommended."
"OR";"Great story with characters who stay consistent, yet grow throughout the series. Fun magical adventures in a well-written story capture the imagination."
"OR";"I was amazed at how easy it is to pick the next big growth stocks with this guide. And of course, it also covers some of the risks of growth investing. This information is key when learning what can be a very complicated type of investing"
"OR";"My kitty got a Urinary Tract Infection, and I was really, really worried this could be an ongoing issue, so I purchased this supplement to add to my existing dietary supplement routine. When I put the full amount (1/4 teaspoon) in her food, she turned her little nose up at it and refused to touch it"
"OR";"I know it's ridiculous to love a butter dish - but I can't help it. I love this butter dish. Keeps our butter so fresh and neat. It's the small things in life."
"OR";"I enjoyed this book very much but then again I love Nora Roberts books!  It was exciting and a page turner, looking forward to the next two books!"
"OR";"Let me tell you - when I say I was on the edge of my seat the entire book I mean that! These characters are CRAZY & book 2 is about to be lit. Smh. I just know its going down"
"OR";"I used this shortly after receiving it and will use it a LOT more for my work.  I drill thru HM doors and this ensures the thru hole on the other side is lined up properly with the initial hole.  No more correcting a slightly off hole with this guide."
"OR";"Nice to have a self inflation feature included in the pad. Still working on the right psi to inflate it to. Too much and you're rolling off the thing all night. Too little and you're touching the ground. Over all a good mattress once you dial in the feel."
"OR";"This Bipod is very nice. Attaches easy with two mounting options. Fold up easy and the spring loaded stands are very nice. The only thing that would make it better for this price would be the option to fold legs up in either direction."
"OR";"great look for non power cables to go in and out of the wall. i have one of these behind each hanging tv in my house and a few sonos cat 5 cables"
"OR";"I added these two batteries, which came at an unbelievable low price to the one that came with my Pansonic Lumix camera and now I can shoot for days and days without recharging."
"OR";"It's a simple riser block. It has small rubber feet that hold it in place.  It's the perfect height for my cycle ops trainer.  The block is relatively inexpensive and does the job.  I recommend it."
"OR";"Overall I really do like this product its long, its cute, it works, the only problem is that it is cheaply made... I had mine for less than a month and one of the straps broke, its nothing a sewing kit won't fix but it would be nice if I didn't have to do such things."
"OR";"What an amazing collection of stories. If you like spanking, erotica, and cowboys this is the box set for you. There was not a story that I did not like in this set. Each one is as strong and alpha as the next."
"OR";"I didn't know matthew mcconaughey had so much SWAGG! The movie keep my attention the entire time. It did not have a typical resolution nor was it predictable leading up to it. It was well written and well portrayed. It was convincing and real. I wish more movies were this well developed."
"OR";"This is a nice little odor eliminator... keep it going on low for maintenance.  The high setting is quite noisy unfortunately, but i like using it on low."
"OR";"this is a nice windbreaker jacket for cool weather. it is thin and lightweight. I'm not used to this type of collar but that's not a big deal. nice fit."
"OR";"Ummmmm . . . this actually didn't work with my Mac.  Didn't work with Yosemite.  Gave it away to someone who had Windows.  Maybe they fixed the problem but I don't have it anymore."
"OR";"This has been a great tag holder.  I can put it on my dog collar, and move it to another collar easily when we change to another collar. It fits my 1"" collar just right."
"OR";"He try to get back with Anna seem there are people try to keep them apart. It seem he is lying to her again a great book love it just wished James wasn't a jerk! Need to read this book it tell you how guy are jerk and players."
"OR";"The Kind of Law Enforcement People Love. Chuck Norris in the Role of a Sheriff who Protects the People from harm. This is classic TV. If you like Chuck Norris - this series is for you."
"OR";"This insanely cheap router outdoes everything else that is under $100. It can handle streaming movies and multiple games at once no problem. I imagine if you have a family of 4 or more all using devices maybe you would hit some caps, but it has been nothing but great for me."
"OR";"Very cute.  I made two out of this towel...same design on both sides...crocheted a top with button to hang from oven or refrigerator door handle.  Makes two nice gifts."
"OR";"It's perfect for our 5 month old. She loves sitting in it while I'm cooking, in the shower, or doing other chorus around the house. Couldn't live without this seat!"
"OR";"My tongs went to a church barbecue and ended up in the utensil drawer so I bought these to replace them.  These are much better than the ones in the church drawer!  I really like them."
"OR";"I've only had it for 6 months. Half the screen doesn't even show up anymore and now it's not vibrating for notifications or when I've met my goal. Serious suckage. Will not purchase this brand again."
"OR";"What a great collection of software freebies - thanks, Bob, for producing some great tips for the Kindle.  As a long-time, loyal subscriber to your newsletters, I'm appreciative of this ebook.  It is like a gift to us on your birthday.  Happy Birthday..."
"OR";"Great product.  I do a variety of construction projects and am a House Painter as a profession.  I do run into a lot of drywall repair and replacement jobs and this is a great kit."
"OR";"This strap seems to be made well but doesn't seem to be sturdy enough in some of the sewing details to last longer than a few months of repeated regular use."
"OR";"This is a fairly good white dress shirt, but it's quality is not quite as good as what I usually buy.  After not much use, the collar lost its crease."
"OR";"Ever since I was a little baby, I always be dribblin'
In fac', I was de baddest dribbler in the whole neighborhood
Then one day, my mama bought me this basketball
And I love this basketball

But seriously, great quality, weight, durability."
"OR";"We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our oldest. She loves it. So does our toddler as well. In fact, we may be purchasing another one for little sister soon."
"OR";"The second season has not let me down. So far it has been great and hopefully when this season is done they will come back with a third. You can't help getting involved with the characters. What good entertainment just enough action, romance, secrets and family problems."
"OR";"Just bought some of these from Walmart for $1.98....$8 seems a little ridiculous.

I haven't used them yet...trying to make an adapter to match the threaded part (my hydration pack is not Outdoor Products).
Other than that they seem well designed and worth 2-5 dollars."
"OR";"These are complete crap. I had modest hopes from the beginning, but my hopes were completely dashed when the 2 blue bulbs I purchased provided poor light output and light that was more white than blue. Don't waste your money on these."
"OR";"My cat loves to play with these balls.  I must've gone through a dozen of them because they always get lost in my apartment, or my cat chews them out.  These balls are incredibly light, making it super fun for my cat to chase and bounce around the floor."
"OR";"We bought this board for pre-photo prep for a collection of 4-6"" dolls. This board is useful for a tabletop, counter, or other work surface. Well padded and narrow end allows us to get to tiny costume areas."
"OR";"Very good movie.  To think of the possibility that are world could be like in this movie.  I thought the movie was well written and had many good actors in it."
"OR";"We got this game as a gift, but this version of it had tiny plastic stones instead of the larger glass ones. Our kids are 4 and 5 and the larger stones would have been preferable, plus it is advertised as glass. We won't keep this one."
"OR";"These are terrific gloves. My go-to glove and far superior to what I'm used to...Pear Izumi. The padding is different but works well for my hand. The pull loops for taking the gloves off is very durable. And of course the price...very affordable."
"OR";"Good, cheap shooting glasses. These are not $100+ glasses, that much is evident. But the lenses are distortion-free and the frames are sturdy enough for use with ear protection over the arms."
"OR";"This toy exceeded my expectations.  It's great to add some kibble and some smaller treats.  My pup rolls it around with his notes and sometimes bats at it with his paws.  It keeps him busy for several minutes.  Cleaning is easy as it folds inside out."
"OR";"Get this for the wand alone.  The crown is a complete disappointment overall.  Its far too small and you can definitely tell its just a cheap plastic crown.  If you can find the crown in metal that is also sold on Amazon, go with that instead."
"OR";"I have being  using these chaps for over 2 years. Well made, a must for anyone using a chainsaw. can get a bit hot in warm weather,"
"OR";"This is one of the best books I've read. Full of adventure, you ache with tragedy, and cry in the good parts. But it's light, the bad things not overdone in gross detail, just enough to pull the emotion of the reader. This is a book to be proud to have on your shelf."
"OR";"The kite is easy to put together and take apart to put back in the sleeve. The colors are bright and pretty, and it flies well. What's not to like!"
"OR";"Nice read, good characters, sweet love story.  Enjoyed reading the conclusion to the trilogy.  The touch of suspense added to its appeal."
"OR";"While this book isn't page after page of humor;  it is a wealth of information about what our government, National Park Service and Forest Service, as well as some wealthy private citizens, have been allowed to do to our wilderness areas."
"OR";"Just as good as the battery that comes with the GoPro but cheaper and you get two. I have not tried to charge the official battery in the charger but the Wasabi batteries charge in the GoPro fine."
"OR";"This is so cute and fun and nice! I can never just sit peacefully and do my makeup without my daughter wanting to grab stuff out of my makeup bag. Now she can sit and ""do her makeup"" with me. Really happy with this realistic but pretend makeup!"
"OR";"Great fit for my Iris floor mat holder. But I would get them anyway. My lil guy has a big bladder an others can't hold it.
these are large allowing for that search for the best spot with out taking up a lot of space."
"OR";"Have only used for a short time, but it appears to be made well and will last.  My small dog shouldn't break it, and I liked the way they attached the clips."
"OR";"The material of the bag is a smooth and soft and very suitable for ladies to carry. Not sure will it last long as it doesn't really feel solid. Nevertheless, it will take the biggest of the manduka mat except the big square 1."
"OR";"These are so cute! My 19-month-old and 3-year-old love them! They are definitely worth the buy. I use them for homeschool music time. They add so much interaction and involvment."
"OR";"I enjoyed Better When He's Bold. Race is much different than Bax, but it was a good different. I really enjoy Jay Crownover's stories. Another good one. Keep up the awesomeness Ms. Crownover's, and I'll keep buying."
"OR";"I love these books! Like Hunger games, but better!! Looking forward to the 3rd one! Lots of action in this crazy world she describes!"
"OR";"I have an 8 year old Maltipoo that's about 5 lbs overweight but a picky eater. She devours these treats and I'm glad they're on the healthy side being grain free, wheat free and holistic."
"OR";"Great product.  Device attached easily, many choices of rings, including holiday.  Sound level good enough for entire apartment."
"OR";"Very flat plug, 3 prong, sturdy wire sheathing, does angle down to the right.  Should fit behind any piece of furniture.  A very good buy, I recommend."
"OR";"She fought for what she wanted.  Both knew that wife was a hot mess, he was willing to give wife another chance but the babysitte was lilke no, I'm fighting for what I want this time."
"OR";"I couldn't read this book quick enough to find out what was going to happen in each character's life. I would recommend this book to anyone, along with the entertainment the book gave, there are also many scriptures that were give to help you with your day to day lives."
"OR";"We love these!  We buy a new one about every 18 months or so just because we like our dogs to have new ones as we wash them frequently and that takes its toll on them."
"OR";"This is a must-have for families going to the beach! I've hauled s a lot of beach stuff including 6 tall beach chairs, beach bags, umbrella, and coolers in one load!"
"OR";"The light is precious, but seems a little top heavy.  I'm afraid that it might fall out of the plug, so am having to return it.  Otherwise, beautiful design and captivating glow."
"OR";"I really enjoyed reading this, as I used to be a Literacy tutor, and I am fascinated by all sorts of ideas related to learning. I was really impressed by the human drive toward knowledge and learning."
"OR";"Band is unbelievably small, if you have large breasts but have the width of a stick, you should be able to fit into it nicely. Very disappointing. Material is awfully cheap, the knots in the back that hold your straps are plastic... One good tug and it snaps and breaks."
"OR";"This tower is big for a mid tower but I like it

Came warped in plastic

Clean Nice paint job

Cant complain yet great tower!!!"
"OR";"long story with tragic story of lives lost without purpose or results. Far too much talk of lives wasted and spent on meaningless tasks."
"OR";"I bought this storage cube to put all of my knitting in next to my couch. I couldn't use the lid because my wooden knitting loom was to large. So, I use the lid as a dinner tray. Works for me.

It's a solid construction. Worth the price, for sure."
"OR";"This is my 2nd time of purchasing this product.  My cats just love it and completely wore the old one out.  Best part, it's made right here in the USA!!!"
"OR";"I just finished installing this timer so can't comment on longevity yet. All my house fans are on timers but my previous Levitron timers are breaking after about 5 years. I'm hoping this Woods brand lasts longer.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with"
"OR";"Looks good, feels good and really cool, figuratively and literally!  It's true to size and is made of really nice material and very functional.  I really like  the removable recoil gel from the pouch. Haven't shot with it yet."
"OR";"Highly recommendable. Great piece of blueray disc. Jackie can really hit the high note flawlessly. She's amazing young operatic artist."
"OR";"Keeps my babies regular and they love the flavor!  I use one packet and mix it in with kitty wet food and place equal amounts on their dish."
"OR";"I love this product, I use it for work and for running, that's why I bought another one...I really like this product thinking of ordering some more."
"OR";"I find this will not work with any of the wireless functions on my 5D Mark II, but flash comp works good,
and it does the basic ETTL/II functions. I can't complain about this product at all. High Speed Sync works
great with compliant flashes."
"OR";"I have been buying Jungle Mocs for my wife for years and finally said, what the hey, I should try them myself and so I bought them and now understand why my wife and everyone loves them,. Give your tired feet a present of a snuggly yet supportive shoe you can wear anywhere."
"OR";"This book was short but very sweet,  a fun ghostly tale that I won't soon forget. I did not see the end coming the way it did, shocked!  But what a wonderful story."
"OR";"We hoped to use these both inside for presentations, as well as outside for backyard family movies.

The slightest wind will knock it off the table, and break the feet if they're clamped."
"OR";"I ordered the 3-pack in ""Barely There"" and received a box meant for three pairs that clearly said 3-pack on it, but when I opened it, there were only two pairs inside!  In addition, the color was much darker than what I have bought in the past that was the same color, so I am sending these back."
"OR";"Both Lawson books were amazing!  Great characters, intriguing story line, hot sex, and a wonderful twist in the end! Highly recommend"
"OR";"Great book. So inspirational. Wish this was more common knowledge. These women are absolutely fantastic role models for people everywhere. Ties in well with the move."
"OR";"I've had a nearly identical model for years, and recently bough this one. It is a cost efficient way to keep documents and other valuables safe. It is sturdy, closes securely, and is waterproof and moderately fireproof. Highly recommended."
"OR";"Dies work great. On par with every other Hornady die set I've used. Topped mine with the Microjust and have had excellent results."
"OR";"I needed a long HDMI cable to hook up my HP laptop via a DATAPORT->HDMI adapter to the TV set, and this works perfectly.  Now just have to figure out how to make it transfer audio too from the PC to the TV via that interface."
"OR";"I love every book she has ever written and look forward to every new one that she comes out with. She just can't write them fast enough for me."
"OR";"Just what I expected..Very good product and a fair price...Will buy again....I have told a few friends about this buy and they seemed quite surprised at my savings....Fast delivery time."
"OR";"Works well... records games... but if you are looking to use it for recording anything else through your XBOX, it won't work. Its just game play, not Netflix or TV."
"OR";"Probably not a bad idea to get this extension with the gas can.  It just makes it easier.  Good product.  Does not leak a single drop...that was one of my unfounded concerns."
"OR";"I am very happy with these glasses. I bought them for my 12 year old son when he is shooting airsoft guns and archery. He likes these so much better than other safety glasses because they are very clear and aren't too big on his face. And for safety glasses, they look better than most."
"OR";"It's so bad that I merely FF through it. Dakota is laughable, and idk wth is with the guy cast as Christian. Had this been Alexander Skaarsgard and Mila Kunis we would've had one great film."
"OR";"I have had two of these and they are waterproof and comfortable to wear.  Both of them lost function after four to six months.  The step counting is good if you wal and swing your arms, or if you run.  Slow walking, or pushing a cart will  not be picked up as steps."
"OR";"I've owned several of these (I lose them frequently), and I love them. They would be a perfect 5, except they come with the terrible U3 software, with no indication of how to remove it. Here is how to remove it:
[."
"OR";"This is a very high-quality lubricant but it is a pain in the neck that the surface you're applying it to has to be warm/hot in order to use the product effectively. Because of this hindrance in regard to effort and time I won't be purchasing this again."
"OR";"Stories including war era Germany always pique my interest.  This story combined that with baking making it a must read.  The characters were believable; the story moved along at a good pace.  Overall, a worthwhile book to read."
"OR";"You did it again Rhonda. I loved Chris and Kate in this sequel. And those Garrison females are something else. I hope we get to see if Chris wins an Oscar and if they ever get a chance to start that family they want. Keep them coming."
"OR";"Nice lock. Good looks and easy to install.(If old lock installed correctly)Bought this to replace old lock that had worn out. Installed in about an hour but that included fixing a bad installation previouly. Recomend and would buy again."
"OR";"These socks a so cute!  My daughter is obsessed with all things cat, and these socks are her favorite.  They are durable and have held up well even after several washes.  I will be ordering more when she outgrows these."
"OR";"It's an emergency blanket in the shape of a bivy. It is not a ""sleeping bag"" just sayin. It's o.k. for what it's designed for, but don't be miss-lead this isn't something you would count on for a week in the woods camping."
"OR";"My 9yr old has worn them three times skiing. Temp highs were -2, 2, and 34F. They work in the cold, and he isn't complaining about his feet being cold. For a little more you can buy a tougher sock, but my son would out grow them."
"OR";"Very nice. Good quality for the price. Look forward to giving as a wedding gift & feel certain new bride & groom will like it."
"OR";"I got this for my baby bunny sice she outgrew her Savic Sputnic. She doesn't like traditional hides and likes to be elevated off the ground. I'm not sure how long it will last because she's been chewing on it all day but so far she seems to enjoy it!"
"OR";"Idk... maybe its just my cats..
But this toys a waste of money my cats aren't exactly smart enough to figure this out.. or plot twist are too smart for this the flip it over to get the treats they don't care for it entertainment wise."
"OR";"I have ordered this item in the past, and it works perfectly. However, I never received the item. There are older iMac computers where I work, and a presentation needed to be given."
"OR";"This version of Risk has you fighting for control of middle earth.  There are four sets of armies to chose from gold and green are the Alliance of Elves and Men while red and black are the armies of Mordor.  The this version of risk adds in generals, strongholds and the fellowship of the ring movie "
"OR";"Dickens, along with Dostoevsky, stands atop my list of novelists who could most accurately portray the subtleties of human emotion and passion.  ""Great Expectations"" is simply a masterpiece of 19th-century fiction, and is pure Dickens.  In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' wri"
"OR";"This set of blades was easy to install and worked perfect. The piece that holds the blades is actually an upgrade from what came with my original Makita hand planer."
"OR";"Another well written story. Great characters, many plots and sub plots. Lots of action. Keeps you turning the pages."
"OR";"Precisely what was needed to make the Sigma a tactical hi-cap 9mm. I would recommend this to any of the people that have come to see the quality and value of the ""American Glock""."
"OR";"Slow but gets there; wish this story could  be true somewhere- two main characters truly come across as made for each other- now that's hot."
"OR";"arrived ontime and had a good varity of newer and older cards only downside was a few weere damaged but hey all is good as always i will buy from card rush again"
"OR";"This works a little better than most clumping litters, but it still tracks and doesn't do as good a job as Cedarific to fight odor. It is very expensive to pay $18 to barely fill two litter boxes; won't purchase in the future."
"OR";"Finally a shoe that allows so much comfort, have been wearing them since they arrived! so comfortable I am in my mid sixty's and a very petite woman and these shoes look very feminine on Thank you !"
"OR";"super light weight, yet comfortable enough to wear all day. only downside is the mesh can get dirty real easy and is hard to clean."
"OR";"If you like hallmark made-for-tv movies, then this is for you. If you hate hallmark with a run-like-a-zombie passion, avoid this. This is a film about the emotional aspect of having to outlived the dead by somekind of plague. VERY EMOTIONAL but not a tear jerker. Just average."
"OR";"K2 brand of inline skates are amazing. Rubber wheels, soft shoe. Super smooth ride. Easily maneuverable. My eight children prefer these over any other kind they've ever owned."
"OR";"This is an excellent movie.  However, the constant fat shaming for comedy truly makes me cringe these days.  Even so, this is a fun movie to watch, most of the time."
"OR";"Had many compliments from coworkers. Holds alot of stuff. Great ""cheap"" price from Amazon. Will see how well it holds up, but right now am satisfied with my purchase."
"OR";"Love it!  Sturdy. Beautiful. Comes pretty darn sharp, but I plan on getting it just a bit more 'razor's-edge'. Nice leather sheath (which I plan on waterproofing)."
"OR";"An easy to read book with short chapters.  Carol tells interesting stories about her professional and personal life.  Recommended for your reading pleasure."
"OR";"This card is the most popular card according to my children. Plus there are a lot of cards to keep re-summoning it. There is also a deck that is based on this card that works really well."
"OR";"This is a surprisingly engaging story.  Nicely crafted.  For the years I spent in Pocock boat it never occurred to me that there was a person by that name.  The book took me back to the boat and the feeling of a proper set on still water at dawn."
"OR";"Writing is crisp and efficient; Harry maintains a taut line throughout as he looks to prove out his theories; and when the evidence proves him wrong he's quick to change horses and keep riding hard--"
"OR";"I fell in love with this in the very first chapter. It made me warm and fuzzy all over. I simply couldn't put it down I finished it in just under 2 hours. I am sure you will love it as much as I did. I received an ARC in exchange for my honest review and it in no way influenced my review."
"OR";"Engrossing. Enthralling. Heart-stopping. This book is simply awesome. Characters are complex. Storyline unpredictable. I've become addicted to the stories of Brent Weeks."
"OR";"These JBL Stereo Headphones (ear buds, really) have brought music back to my ears.  Since losing most of the hearing in one ear (and about 20% in the other), my experience of music was drastically altered.  Stereo became an aberrant mono, movement became stuck in place, and range became unpleasantly"
"OR";"We have had so much fun with this. We have 3 now. Just wish the bubble stuff was better. The bubble wand works great but hard to find good bubble solution."
"OR";"A timeless classic bringing together some greats - Jimmy Dean such a good actor.  Great acting all around really. Love that blu ray"
"OR";"They are very well made, comfortable, and warm. One of the best fitting pair of socks I've ever owned. They also do a great job of wicking the moisture away from your skin. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great quality sock."
"OR";"Unbelievable! This was such a rare car, and I thought it would be cool. But no, soon after I bought it, the tow cable came off, and the paint on the windshield got scratched off. Not recommending this to anybody!!"
"OR";"Product is as described. It's very nice and the price was excellent. My son will love it. It may need to air out a little as this particular bracelet has a very strong smell."
"OR";"Just received my DVD copy. Warners have done it again. The Picture quality is magnificant and the sound superb. ""Get Happy"" looks as though it were filmed yesterday."
"OR";"I have used about three-fourths of a jar (possibly purchased elsewhere). It now has a fairly strong smell of paint thinner, or something similar, when I open the jar. It is not labeled as organic. Perhaps that odor is pesticide."
"OR";"My two ""boys"" are crazy for these and bat them up and down a 50 ft. hallway for extended periods. Most balls lose their interest quickly! There's something in the design that attracts them so much that they even share a ball:-)"
"OR";"It does what I intended.  It has a heavy rubber smell that is slow to dissipate. It helps but I sweat so much that I am not sold that it really helps my situation.  My eyes do not burn anymore and I guess I should be happy with that."
"OR";"Another excellent book about Jess Williams. The books are to short and need to be longer. I'm not very happy about the price increase for a short read."
"OR";"These are the only pet blankets we will use for our dogs. They absolutely LOVE, & I mean LOVE these blankets! I am grateful to the other reviewer's here, as they were quite helpful to me. My dogs thank them too ;-)

They are very soft, one side smooth and soft, & the other side... soft Sherpa warmth"
"OR";"This dear man could well be the hope of a hurting nation. I expect to see him rise to a position of considerable power and influence. The book details his struggles and victories. He shows us all that we only have the limitations we place upon ourselves."
"OR";"Wow, what a great little flashlight that packs a punch.  This thing is way brighter than my LED flashlight with 4 LED's and I love the adjustable spotlight.  It puts out a nice big round spotlight depending how near or far you are."
"OR";"I liked better the other ones.  All Access and Broken Sound were far better!  This one has a lot of loose ends and it's not really as good as the others."
"OR";"This is great!  My hubby can have a little bit of the nerd in him in the kitchen without me going crazy.  It's a fun little decor that doesn't take up too much room."
"OR";"The basket is a nice heavyweight stainless steel and seems to be just what I needed. The vegetable peeler also seems to be of nice quality.
The follow - up service was good too."
"OR";"I am a big Beatles fan but always had mixed feelings about John. He was obviously a great musician and showman. His Imagine album is wonderful, and his plea for peace in the title song is downright anthemic for the peace movement. He truly believed in love; his favorite lyric was ""All you need is lo"
"OR";"I read reviews before ordering so I knew it would be small. I'm normally a small/medium 5'9"" so I order a XL and it fits almost too small after washing"
"OR";"a good book, interesting story, kept my interest.  nothing exceptional, just a good, solid read.  I would recommend this book"
"OR";"Delivery Man... cute idea, ok script, still yet another Vince Vaughn movie,  If you like his acting is worth watching ONCE...  Predictable Hollywood box office hail mary pass"
"OR";"I thought this DVD slightly below an average National Geographic video once there is more personal dramas than scienfic information. However I was moved by the story of a teacher with a brain tumor and his family anxiety."
"OR";"best rice cooker ever. simple to use like 4 button simple. can make rice that stays fresh for a while with a keep warm feature."
"OR";"I love these! They are about 1/2 inch too big. I ordered a women's 8 (my regular size). There wasn't an option for 7.5 so just going to stick with them. The color is a sky blue as shown. I'm going to wear them for my wedding. Sooo cute."
"OR";"Totally cool trick scooter. My 10 year old adores it and rides it almost every day! It's light but sturdy and does tricks like a breeze!"
"OR";"Nice design.  Opticall and mechanically, it works.  It is easy to attach and position on my iPhone and the optics are sharp.  If I were goingb to suggest a change,mit would be fo bayonet rather than screw-threads to connect the parts for faster setup."
"OR";"Great bra for the money. will buy again. Although I don't feel any ""gel"" in the strap. it is easier on the shoulders. I have fibromyalgia. ANY help with my left shoulder is a win, win for me!!  I also can't wear underwires, so it's a really good bra, for me."
"OR";"These novella add clarity and an additional layer of emotion to a fantastic series.  Reading from both Warner an Adam's points of view helps clarify some events that the limited by Juliette's point of view.  Love it."
"OR";"Chincy, Chincy, Chincy - pieces were soooo small and fragile - kids couldn't even put together -
the parts were so small too - totally disappointed"
"OR";"Fabric shelves are as tight as a drum head, no sag.  Plenty of clearance space between shelves.  As a guy after I filled it with my shoes, I put my hats on the other shelves.  It takes a bit of perseverance to assemble, but it is built to last."
"OR";"There aren't many movies I watch over and over, but this is one. There is no sexual misconduct, no one gets hurt, and all the good guys and gals get a happily-ever-after.

When I feel frustrated because my dreams feel out of reach, this is a feel-good movie that helps me feel better."
"OR";"Brought this mainly because of brand had been wearing this jean for 20years.
Color look same as picture and size also quite accurate.

Will recommend to my friends to buy."
"OR";"A little more depth would be nice. This book, although riveting, is very short. Left me wanting more. Would like to know if his other books are as short."
"OR";"I purchased two of these. One for a gift for a friend, the other for me.
Both of us really like them.  They are beautiful and keep our Mah Jongg racks well protected."
"OR";"I love these labels! I especially love the pic of the herb or spice with the name. I wish there was a bigger variety, though. I have a lot of spices and herbs that weren't in the group."
"OR";"Excellent auxiliary lighting for times when you need both hands & have no place to mount a fixture. This is very bright, & so light-weight & comfortable, I can wear it for long periods without it bugging me."
"OR";"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree"
"OR";"Good strength to the structure, but the top tips of the mold don't release very well. I had to create my own tips after unmolding this. Still, I would recommend this if you're looking for the Taj Mahal. It is a nice size and holds up well, even to some heat."
"OR";"Had a couple of touch lamps that were going on the fritz.  Decided to try these.  Easy to install and they work as advertised.  Good product at a good price!"
"OR";"Nice family comedy, but Kevin James slapstick falls short. Nice to watch, really enjoyed it, but wouldn't buy or watch twice."
"OR";"This is a suspenseful story and had lots of twists and steamy scenes. It got kind of dark at a certain point but that just made me want more and more. The characters each had their own secrets and they eventually came to terms with them and together they worked them out. I enjoyed reading this story"
"OR";"So far I'm really liking this hard case. I got it for my AK-47. I initially was looking for a soft case in the 25 to 35 dollar range,  but had trouble finding one that could hold the long 30 round AK mags in their pouches. I opted for this case instead and was pleasantly surprised to find that I can"
"OR";"The magnet seem to be chipping apart. As to how it works with feeding, its great. Drop a frozen cube in and it spins with the flow and lets it out in a controlled fashion. When the fish see I added a cube, they father below it waiting for their meal."
"OR";"Spray tube was missing from the can so I have to go to a bricks & mortar store now just to get it.

The cap on the can is notched to store the spray tube so someone screwed up and didn't include it in my shipment.

Ugh..."
"OR";"Even though I measured my dog before purchasing this harness and bought the recommended size, I cannot get the front straps (where the least clips in) to be small enough to fit his body. He can fully get out of it and this is incredibly dangerous. I want a full refund!"
"OR";"Great Price for 2 batteries and a charger. Shooting video with a DSLR consumes a lot of battery and having extra ones is imperative. These don/t last as long as the Canon ones but are way way cheaper. I would Highly recommend them."
"OR";"I have to use it as a PC link instead of a field programmer. My Castle Link quick connect does not allow this to function independently of a computer. I imagine it would work perfectly if I wired it directly to the ESC though."
"OR";"Very good dynamic range. Comfortable to wear with easy controls. When changing stations and when you land on good station/reception, a ladies voice announces the station number."
"OR";"Very modern looking and works well for small bathroom.  The sound of the fan is not bad.  Sure you can hear it is running, but it is not obnoxious noise.  I was painting the ceiling on a very cold windy day and there was no cold air blowing back into the bathroom."
"OR";"I put this string on my head Ti. s6, with some lead tape, I can heat the ball a lot harder than before, and this string can stay the shape whatever how hard you hit the ball."
"OR";"Green is so cool. Why would ANYONE want to build on anything other than green?  I guess if you're into naval stuff. But come on! GREEN!  Soylent GREEN is made out of PEOPLE!!!!!"
"OR";"I have been carrying this knife for over a year, no signs of wear and as sharp as ever. A few strokes on a ceramic stick, and it's like new. Very impressive to see and use. The best carry knife I've ever had. (and I've had an used a lot of knives)"
"OR";"Very fun, traditional chick lit.  Starts off with a steamy sex scene right at the beginning to hook you in (mmmm....).  Will not disappoint Green's avid fans.  Definitely recommend."
"OR";"I've used this movie for many years for my summer day camps, and for introducing ""eventing"" to young people.  Enjoyable movie for kids and adults."
"OR";"This series is my absolute favorite.  Very believable in a science fiction way and impossible to put it down once you start..even though I never wanted it to end.  Thank you Mr Goleman"
"OR";"I love this type of novel. Amazing to learn of the horror and general lack of regard certain classes/leaders had towards human life Zamazimngly well told"
"OR";"Seems fitted for Asian physiques.  If proportions are correct for arm length and shoulders, chest is too tight.  Torso length is also short.  Otherwise I like the jacket."
"OR";"This light is 1. bright, 2. is very sensitive to movement, far away, too 3. works with sun on it only 3 hours/day.

This is a GREAT value at this price."
"OR";"NK Jemisin knocks it out of the park with her world building every time. The magic comes from the planet. Or vice versa. Can't wait for the next one!"
"OR";"Our granddaughter loves to carry this radio around with her and has been playing with it since she was about 9 months old.  She is 2 years old now and still enjoys it.  It appears it could be something she will use through age 3 or 4.  Good selection of tunes."
"OR";"This second in the series deals with a totally different sort of crime. A political conspiracy that erupts into a violent ending that you will not want to miss. I am getting ready to read the third book in the series and can't to see what the Hunters do next."
"OR";"I installed four of these bulbs in kitchen recess fixtures less than a year ago, and three of them have already gone dark.  These lights probably burned 5 hours a day on average.  Do the math, and do not buy these bulbs."
"OR";"This is a fantastic item for the money. It is large and roomy inside and wheels are very easy . We plan to travel with it as a carry on and it will be exactly what we need. Even a padded section for the iPad ."
"OR";"Very slow start. I had a hard time getting into it until about 60-70 pages in. After the initial ""slow"" pages, it picked up and I enjoyed the story. Some parts of the ending were foreshadowed early on in the book, but the major plot twist at the end I did not see coming."
"OR";"I really wanted to like this show because I know that Louis CK is respected as a comic genius. But despite a few funny moments, I didn't care for it. It is too crude and gross for my taste. To each her own."
"OR";"This is the only rawhide that doesn't give my dog diarrhea.  He loves them even though he is a medium size Sheltie. Carries it everywhere with him.  Hope I can always get them for him!"
"OR";"Despite the criticisms of this history, I found it to be incredibly easy to read and very entertaining. I'll leave it to others to comment on its accuracy, but it seems plausible as an accurate interpretation of the reign of one of the most famous and important Queens in history."
"OR";"We used this on a camping trip. 2 people (one plus size) and a dog slept on it and it held up great. Well worth the money."
"OR";"The story about tangi and ZaBria was an exact story from another author (Tracee Boyd) beautiful damaged. only thing changed were the names. Not sure if I'm tripping, but somethings not right. Two different authors. Same exact words."
"OR";"Don't be fooled by the appearance of this puzzle. The short diagonals DO NOT ROTATE at all, and the long diagonals don't rotate on the axes you'd expect. It's just a 3x3 Rubik's cube pretending to be something new."
"OR";"Gave them several tries. Made sure tile was clean, suction cups were clean, suction properly applied. No go. Cannot recommend. They're in the trash."
"OR";"I wholeheartedly agree with those who've said that the DVD is of poor quality. In fact, it's awful quality and spoils the enjoyment of an otherwise really good comedy/mystery type. It's a fun picture to watch. Too bad it wasn't digitally re-mastered."
"OR";"This is a nice story with engaging characters and plot.  Like Hallmark movies, you know how the story will end,but there are enough twists to be entertaining."
"OR";"It was a little smaller than I thought would be, but quite adequate.  The finish quality is excellent and it works just like it is supposed to...easy to make settings."
"OR";"Update, my last 5 containers were bent on each end which made my cupcakes lean. So happen I just ordered from Websturant and was able to use the new ones."
"OR";"i love the con-tact brand lite tack light adhesive shelf liner. easy to install and easy to remove with no residue.  The regular contact is difficult to remove and leaves an adhesive mark on the shelf."
"OR";"These shoes are high quality. Cute and durable. Had to give them away due to her growing rather than them wearing out. Look great, and wash well too."
"OR";"I have several single layer rings which my cats will play with, but unfortunately, they (cats) always manage to get the balls out of the rings.  That has not happened with this multi-layered toy.  The cats love playing with it and I am happy to finally find something that stands up to them."
"OR";"I loved the book and storyline.  I encourage you to read it too!  I've been very pleased with the selection on the free section!  I have found many new authors this way!"
"OR";"On the box it smells heavenly. But as I suspected, when it burns the scent is more like a burning perfume. Not as delicate as other incenses that I tried. This is just my opinion.
I keep them in my drawers and closet, and they scent beautifully without the need of lighten them!"
"OR";"Great value and well made! They added a lot to my parents' anniversary party and we plan on reusing them for a birthday part next month."
"OR";"This was a fun read. Misty Malone put together a nice story of two couples who really clicked. I loved that she added a story line that included some danger and intrigue along with DD. The title was spot on, you won't be disappointed."
"OR";"Yes! A book with such a great story line! It was well put together and kept u ready for what's going to happen next!"
"OR";"This is a great interactive food puzzle and works wonders on our high-energy year old pup! Keeps him occupied while we visit with houseguests and instead of jumping up and carrying on, he's learning that guests mean the treat ball comes out"
"OR";"Bought this as a gift upon the recommendation of someone else.  The recipient really likes it.  It had to be easy for him to use because he is 86.  He really seems to like it."
"OR";"Santa give a small one and a medium one for our 2 yo and 5 yo daughters. They love them and play with them daily. It's nice that the unicorns allow them to do some exercises everyday besides playing dolls and quiet games."
"OR";"This set came with cushioned dividers to go between each plate and was much more than I thought.  Especially for the price.  I would highly recommend this for storing your china safely."
"OR";"This is a good shifter romance, with a likeable couple that you want to get their HEA. It is a quick read, just over 70 pages, but the characters are well developed for such a short story. If you are looking for a quick, sweet, and sexy shifter romance, this is a good one."
"OR";"Shirt is not sewn as it should be. Uneven and lopsided sides. Looks like material wasn't cut right and they attempted to sew the mess up. Comfortable but looks awkward on"
"OR";"Oh my gosh did I ever make my eight year great nephew happy with these rocket refills.  I got him the rocket and knew he'd need the refills too."
"OR";"This show tells you the history that school doesn't.  Excellent presentation and acting.  This show really makes you think about what the government and news shows are not telling us."
"OR";"Have a butter knife ready! This is a cute book but I had a bard time opening the slides. I couldn't even grip it and ended up using a butter knife to pry the edge open. Still can't open one off the slides."
"OR";"This is a simple book, yet a great message.  My three year old son loves it, and he has never read this character before.  He typically likes Pooh and fireman and space things, but this has great ""boy"" stuff in it like boats, tanks, etc."
"OR";"these wheels came packed in a good container, they are great wheels and I have used them in the past and was very well pleased, so I don't have any bad words to say."
"OR";"Another great tool for my corgi. I switch from that to The Magic Pro Dog Deshedding Tool from time to time. They are both great tools. I will be a returned customer."
"OR";"Daughter loves her! Although neither of us are familiar with this character. It was Christmas on a budget this year and she happened to be the cheapest My Little Pony Barbie available. Either way my daughter is a fan and doll is cute and a great price - thanks!"
"OR";"So much fun! We had a cowboy theme party for my son's 1st birthday. The guests loved them. Not too durable but that's fine! I consider this a good purchase."
"OR";"Know that this is stronger than most Ick medications, hence the ""super"". If your're not sure how sensitive your fish are, lower the initial dose. If your fish are already weak/stressed out, they most likely won't make it through treatment."
"OR";"Super cute!! Probably just a tad bit tight if worn with socks or if you have wide feet. The rubber soles came unglued after a couple of wears, so these shoes are NOT durable!! Very pricey shoe for it to not stay well put together!!"
"OR";"The item is exactly what is describe.  So I am giving 5 stars.
But, be aware,  it will have to be placed on the item where you may want to use the item with the adhesive backing.  Be sure to have a place that will be okay to attach with adhesive.  I placed them on the back of my nightstand."
"OR";"This was an excellent book. It introduces new and useful information (& conceptualizes older information) about a topic that is increasingly influencing human beings, and other animals. A bit scary, but inevitable."
"OR";"Upgrading old infrastructure of patched together cables, worn cables, and old cameras, the cost of these is perfect for the current project where additional length is needed."
"OR";"This is probably my tenth pair of Nike Lunarglides. Every runner has their loyalties to certain shoes and this is mine. If you have a somewhat narrow foot and desire stability with responsive cushioning, this is the shoe for you. It's also very lightweight."
"OR";"I love books that illuminate all that is good in life. The stories of the Lathem family will make you laugh, cry but hopefully leave you with a little of their magic."
"OR";"Fits my arm perfectly. Easy to use and read the time regardless of light level. Easy to set up. Good price."
"OR";"I can't remember the last time I cleaned a toilet. These are the best back-scratchers ever invented. Keep them hidden from any significant other or roommate who might mistakenly misuse it."
"OR";"I was surprised that is was I Chinese with English Dubbed.  I was glad it had the English option but was expecting an English Version.
The story line was so far different than the Disney Version and very Bloody.  Not suitable for children. A little too violent for me and my wife."
"OR";"Bernard Lee did not disappoint with storm. Brought together a great team and worked his magic. Great read again loads of laughs, suspense and twists."
"OR";"way to little, I should have read the product details.  Also metal bars didn't fit into the base plate as the holes were not sized right."
"OR";"Purchased the G-3 with 14-42 kit lens plus a 45-200 and 20mm lens for travel.  I am a serious digital outdoor/travel photographer but tired of traveling with 28+ pounds of pro. level equipment.  I was looking for a ""go light"" quality built camera with lot of features and adjustments.  It came down t"
"OR";"I bought a set for all of my grandkids for the 4th of July to use when the sparklers ran out. They had an awesome time out in the dark yard till one of the kids got hit in the eye. Not any fault of the product. Only one of them has had a problem. It still lights but there is no sound."
"OR";"These are perfect for the firing range! Very effective for ear protection. As far as how they fit, I was worried because I have a big head and thought there was a possibility of them being uncomfortable. They fit very snug, but not painful."
"OR";"Really silky and good feel to it. I have it in a rental and the color hides blood well (hey thats why I buy chocolate). They stand up to heavy washings too."
"OR";"This was a fun movie.  It helps if you are a fan of Streisand.  I am since her first appearance on Jack Paar's Tonight show.  Just nonsense with some underlying truths.  Pure fun."
"OR";"I truly fell in love with all the heroes and heroines  in these three stories, can't wait to  be able to finish the rest of them over time. Thank you for keeping me entertained!"
"OR";"they work well

BUT!!!...

If you bench press alone in your garage or basement, you know the deal don't use them so you can slide the weights off your chest if you get stuck!!"
"OR";"The smokes don't fit in the grooves.  It's as if the plastic cooled to much and shrunk when manufacturing.  Had to smash the ciggs to get them to fit instead of them going in effortlessly."
"OR";"Always wanted to take guesswork out of cooking and this thermometer does that job!  Easy to  use.  Used it on fish with great results.  No more overcooked fish for us!"
"OR";"What can I say.  Its a flashlight.  I bought this particular one because almost all my cordless tools are DeWalt 18 V  Maybe the next generation will have LED bulbs instead."
"OR";"This book is drama filled from the first page.  It will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what's about to happen next.  Loved it and can't wait or part 2"
"OR";"Got the white bone tag. The metal is soft, its been several months now and the edges are scratched . Also, the text is white so hard to see whats written."
"OR";"Poor straps, after one week one of the straps holding the legs was torn apart. I am not heavy, but it seems the material quality of this chair are very low."
"OR";"Arrived quickly and in like new condition. It provides me with lots to learn as I attempt to secure my small home network and learn whatever there is to learn on my limited disabled budget. this is an incredibly interesting topic."
"OR";"so glad that so many books about the atrocities committed against Poles by the Soviets and Germans during WWII are available in English now. There were precious few available when I became interested in the subject back in the early 90's."
"OR";"I loved the characters in this book.  Brandon fell in love with his best friend Faith.  Little did he know, that his mother planned this.  I love the way Francis Ray brings back characters for her previous books.  I can't wait until the next book."
"OR";"The 1 tb drive is great, the 2 tb drive is a bit thicker so not quite as portable, but still a great design and reliable so far."
"OR";"Very bright. Much larger bulb than standard size due to Watt equivalent. There's a slight lag for the bulb to actually turn on after flipping the switch. Not annoying but definitely noticeable compared to other LEDs that we have."
"OR";"this is very different for us as we are used to the glass.  Our problem is that we've been through three glass ones and when I say the stainless, it seemed to be the answer.  We do miss the waterline though."
"OR";"Just received them today. Fit as expected and are fairly comfortable.
There was two weeks between order an arrival, which is pretty bad.

Will update review after wearing for awhile."
"OR";"This thing is awesome! It is very sturdy and if used properly should last a while. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! (Lol, why do we have to write so many words for pete's sake, ugh!)"
"OR";"Off Duty is a fantastic addition to Sawyer Bennett's Off series.  Tim and Holly have amazing chemistry, and Tim's son is the cutest.  The story is also set in the beautiful city of New Orleans.  A great second chance love story!"
"OR";"I love this mouse ... took a bit of time to get use to it (different hand position than any other mouse I've used ... but boy is it comfortable."
"OR";"My husband and I both really like this old movie.  We just wish we could get it on DVD.  We had taped it years ago, but the old tape wore out."
"OR";"A big let down until the very end which left you feeling good about the series. The series just became to long and it felt like the writer got himself into a ""deep dark cavern"" and didn't know how to get out. So a convenient, new storyline is brought up to get out."
"OR";"Very nice shoes, especially for the price. The Blue should have been brighter though, more suede like, but its very stylish to wear with Jeans etc. Love the two tone"
"OR";"Mr. Putter loves giving presents at Christmas time but although he starts planning in July it always takes him until December to decide what to give his neighbor and friend, Mrs. Teaberry. He knows that she likes salt shakers that walk, dresses for her teapots etc. What he can't believe is that she "
"OR";"In this book Chyna is a 26-year-old graduate student still coming to terms with her abusive past. She is staying at her friend's house for the weekend when Edgler Foreman Vess enters the home. When a scream pierces the night, Chyna hides under the bed. Edgler comes in and searches her room but finds"
"OR";"Good quality, thick, shiny and it keeps my tea hot.  It is a good looking cup.  If you like big cups of coffee, this cup is not for you.  I have my big cup for morning coffee and I use this one for afternoon coffee or tea."
"OR";"This Cookware Set Has Performed Great so Far I've Only Had It for about 2 Weeks But Whatever I Have Cooked Has Slid Right out Of on Cleaning The Only Bad Part Is That These Are Not Dishwasher Safe."
"OR";"This little amp did so much more than I expected . I have four 2inch high's  and one 4inch mid and on the sub channel I have a 15 it does not bounce but you get tour bass"
"OR";"A wonderful classic movie. Bert Lancaster is a top notch actor. My family just visited Alcatraz and I thought this is a good movie to remember their trip,"
"OR";"Great shorts/swimshorts. Great Fabric, washes well, no fading or shrinking. I have purchased a few pair for my husband. He loves to fish in them
He says they are very comfortable."
"OR";"Instruction suck. But I went online and afyer figuring it out I love it. The only bad part is you have to change setting in the camera (Canon) and if your target moves and you just want to use your shutter you have to change it back in menu or tou're in timer modr"
"OR";"Without giving anything away this story is an up and down ride of emotions and choices. While I would have liked to have a more uplifting ending, it was still a good read."
"OR";"Liked them when they were a little bigger. But my grandson and I are using it and he likes it. Very durable so far which is a good thing cuz my grandson is a rough one on toys."
"OR";"Great book but unsatisfactory ending she have added a awful or brought back Alicia and her brother some parts felt like the book was winding down"
"OR";"This lock box is awesome. Very sturdy and installs easily. Not a lot of space for big keys, but it will do the trick if you need to leave a key outside and in a safe place."
"OR";"Really comfortable and absorbent. No lumps like other socks. And I find the thin mesh socks let every little tiny stone or piece of bark rub a little tiny sore spot. Not these socks."
"OR";"I read the reviews and thought how bad could it be. It's bad! Feathers get everywhere including your hair. I was supposed to wear it to a costume party, but opted to go without so I wouldn't be embarrassed by a trail of cheap feathers."
"OR";"I ordered this RAM to upgrade what my Mac Mini had in it.  Popped it in and it worked like a champ.  Hats off to Amazon and Crucial for a quality product at an affordable price!"
"OR";"I have not yet read this book. I can, however, tell you it will be great as all of hers are...and I have read practically all of them. They just get better and better...but then I grew up in Maine right on the Canadian border and now live part of each year in North Carolina so this might have someth"
"OR";"Shoes arrived on time but in a torn and very beat up box.  Shoes arrived dirty.  No receipt included in package and it appears shoes have been worn.  Dirt all along rim of shoe.  Disappointed to say the least"
"OR";"Love this.  We are doing My Father's World Exploring Countries and Cultures this year for our homeschool and this globe is perfect.  To top it off, this will be a permanent piece in our home even when we're not doing school."
"OR";"One pouch of this was just enough to add to our dogs meal for one day. They liked it but one day is not enough to gauge the probiotic effects of the product. I have to say that the packaging is ridiculous and I had to struggle mightily to wrestle the cap off the pouch."
"OR";"this is a great spotlight,its very bright an cast a concentrated beam for a long distance.i feel this spotlight will be great for many uses an would recomend to anybody"
"OR";"Paul Newman and Sally Field, what else needs to be said?  If you're into conspiracy movies you will certainly like this one.  I hope it will be put on blu-ray."
"OR";"A friend of mine recommended this book to me. What got my attention are the details on how a person can really push through the limits and just go out there, be confident on yourself and start making conversations."
"OR";"Purchased this for my daughter to carry her ferrets.  It is perfect.  Lots of ventilation, impossible for the ferrets to open, seems fairly rugged but still really cute.
There is a comfy cushion inside for them to lay on.  This comes out if you ever need to wash it."
"OR";"(review by my 14 yr old son): I love how the bow can change draw strengths. This allows me to progress to the full draw weight when I get stronger. I also love the bow's design and that I came with some powerful aluminum hunting arrows. I don't hunt but I do recommend this bow for any youth interest"
"OR";"This is a lovely set of ""silver just right for 18 inch dolls.  I am very pleased to have such a sturdy set and look foreward to passing it along to the next generation someday."
"OR";"I was so excited to get these - but, the design is horrible. The bottom of them is white suede or some kind of fabric. They will be filthy the first time I wear them. They are going right back."
"OR";"I first discovered this book by browsing netflix and the movie version was amazing! I bought all the series. I can't wait til the 7 comes out!"
"OR";"These are given to my 2 rescue dogs at the end of the day.  They know when it is time to go out for the last time at night and sit and wait for their Greenie.  All we have to say is ""do you want to brush your teeth"" and they go nuts.  They love them and their teeth are in great shape..."
"OR";"This bear (and the bunny too) are the only toys that my 5 month old puppy (with razor sharp teeth) hasn't torn to shreds. They've lasted for months with no loose threads or rips. I will be buying the piggy next!"
"OR";"I loved the idea of this-that i could listen to my music in the car. it was easy to set up. but only works fairly. fades in and out frequently. also is easily broken."
"OR";"I don't think they seal as great as I would like, even after installing I can still feel air blowing through the outlet, but that might be from the outlet itself and not around it."
"OR";"An engaging tale that parallels outcomes we might see today. Hard to put down and easy to get into. If there is any criticism it is that details were too deeply researched resulting in a few sections that continued beyond the sale. But in the end that made it all the more believable."
"OR";"Super cute blouse but i have learned my lesson that Asian sizes run small. i usually wear a small and i ordered a medium and it was still too small."
"OR";"Very impressive package and of the Blue Ray picture quality was fantastic!!  Greatest romance ever made. I watch it at once a year after NFL season ends."
"OR";"Former Fat Child Ava and her childhood crush Luke collide in this amazing read!

Ava finds herself going from having no men to having 4 men vying for her attention!

Total page turner!!!"
"OR";"This thing is tiny lol I was expecting a much taller tree. I guess I should have paid more attention to the size chart. It fell over every chance it had and deflated easily. Junk."
"OR";"Unfortunately the black didn't work for a lot of my dresses. I wanted to love it ! The quality is beautiful and shipment and packing super cute. Hopefully, if I order the cream will work out better for me... if I order the other color will leave another review with pictures of what it worked with :)"
"OR";"This was a replacement for another, much softer frisbee that my dog loved but is no longer made.  Unfortunately this one is not nearly as soft but it's the best I have found. One has to be careful as teeth marks in it can be sharp due to its less than pliable and tougher construction."
"OR";"This was terrific in every way!  There was a terrific story here and I think you will enjoy it as much as I did.  This book had everything to keep you glued to it to the very end and then you will wish there was more!  I loved it!"
"OR";"Longest lasting dog toys I have ever bought. Anywhere from days to weeks depending on how excited and determined the dogs get into pulling it apart."
"OR";"The paper towel holder I received is exactly as advertised. Nothing wrong. Has a little bit of weight to it that keeps it from spinning around the counter when you pull off a paper towel."
"OR";"Spoiler alert.  Michelle saves herself from her suddenly animated house by shooting it with a shotgun.  And thats as good as this one got.  Well cast, well directed, great costumes...but nothing can overcome a mediocre script.  Sigh."
"OR";"I was embarrassed when this book arrived and I realized that I had just purchased a dressed up romance novel. The premise sounded great, but it is only a front. Niffenegger is painfully self indulgent. This would be great as a guilty pleasure for someone who can stomach it, but the write-ups are mis"
"OR";"New formula sucks.  Tampered with an iconic brand.

Hey, everyone, try Weimans Brass Polish.  It's exceptional stuff.  Their products are generally amazing.  I am now off Brasso and onto Weimans."
"OR";"I got this for a friend who's 20 year old cat had died.  It is a nice gift for those of us who have our cat or dog as part of our family. I don't know if there is dimensions on the picture part but it only holds a very small picture. The poem is perfect."
"OR";"I Loved this book, great story line, it kept me guessing.  I wouls highly recommend that others read this book."
"OR";"My girlfriend and I watched this and we were laughing out loud through the whole thing.  Adam Sandler is a plastic surgeon and when you see some of the people that come in to get fixed you about die laughing."
"OR";"The best real emotion laden book I have read in a long time. Raw situations drag you in and make you want the characters to be real!"
"OR";"I'm pleased w/ this purchase.  Delivery was on time...have not used it yet, but looks like quality set & all I will need as a DIY guy..."
"OR";"I bought these curtains because my husband works nights and he wanted the room to be nice and dark so he could sleep peacefully during the day. These curtains work beautifully!"
"OR";"This film came out in 1970....The archives say we had no clue as to what the Japanese were planning......However, we were deciphering their codes and messages faster than the ambassador's office could.....Great movie to own without commercials....."
"OR";"Disregard any review where the cable wasn't cut to make a run.  Every reviewer who cut the cable has pointed out that it is not Cat6.  There aren't any copper wires. This cable is junk."
"OR";"These were just like the ones I used when I was small. They fit most dolls, though any young child's imagination can make them fit any doll, or dog, or sibling."
"OR";"It is exactly what I was needing, and the product was nicer than expected. At this price point I didn't expect much quality. It's stackable and I might add a second tier."
"OR";"Keep on writing!!! I absolutely loved this second installment . Your stories keep getting better and better, I cannot wait for book three!"
"OR";"We have fun with this game--but the holes the objects are placed into seem to be bigger than in the set I had as a kid, so it's not as challenging. My kid gets bored a lot faster than I used to."
"OR";"Loved, loved, loved this book! Such a fun love story it's funny, sexy and romantic! The end does leave you hanging though...I can't wait for Rock 2 to come out! Kudos to Olivia Thorne on expressing such passion in words!"
"OR";"Love this camera . Bought for my 8 Year old and she loves it.. light weight good quality. I have always been a Sony fan..."
"OR";"nice job by Grisham. different story lines. noticed he is inputting his political and social views heavily in his books lately but i still like him."
"OR";"If you are frustrated by the limited options of having one keyboard and mouse control multiple machines, this is a must-check-out device.

The JUC400 effortlessly allows me to use one Mac or PC, and control two machines simulatenously from it. I can use my PC laptop to control my Mac mini behind it,"
"OR";"Loved this have used it to make a ham and a turkey breast so far. Works great has easy controls and is super easy to use"
"OR";"ACIM presents the message that Jesus brought to us over 2,000 years ago as a journey from separation to wholeness with no exceptions.  One problem, One answer.  No separation."
"OR";"This story is really about how much Minna and Rhys like eachother and need to confirm their love for eachother. The sex scenes were alot hotter in The Iron Duke, what happened? The plot is interesting and kind gives you more of an insight into this universe."
"OR";"Reminds me of the Karon novels. Does not have a strong plot line. Lots of stories strung together, some for fun and some with a lesson. A nice break from more serious stuff."
"OR";"Works ok but doesn't has extended range. My AT&T Uverse router, that comes for free, has more range than this Router. Couldn't play HD movies on my laptop."
"OR";"Wow! So many twist and turns right up to the end. The setting felt almost Gothic. This character Victor Carl is so interesting you can't wait for the next installment. The author William Lashner has really got it going on."
"OR";"These are great!  Stitching was without an issue - and does what I needed it to do - keep my head from burning on long summer runs.

As an added bonus - I've found if I take my water bottle and pour it on my head - these stay wet for quite a while as well."
"OR";"Yup, it's a light meter.  Cheap and works great. A workhorse for my lab.  Intensity range seems pretty good for normal use."
"OR";"I bought this for my suv  I ask the the men who was install my alarm so he said the fuse in my car is too sensitive to jump so I still have in the box the camara working fine"
"OR";"really liked this book. It was funny and cute. It also had mystery suspense and really hot naughty bits... I would read this again."
"OR";"These are cheap. I'm not talking price wise, I mean cheaply made. The silver has started to flake off and I've bent one of the brass punches already. I'm not happy with them. At least they were Price cheap too. You get what you pay for."
"OR";"This a passionate and emotional short story introducing the reader to a new contemporary series by Julie Lessman.  We get a glimpse into family life and how family dysfunction can tempt us to make life altering mistakes."
"OR";"This is a ditto on the previous review.  Bought it at Walmart.  Installed it , did not work as advertised.  I had to hold the receiver no further than 6 inches from the transmitter.  I too though it could be the batteries so I bought two fresh ones with the same result.  I am contacting the manufact"
"OR";"This is the second pair of these that I get. They are great and this new model is even better than the first. They have added spring hinges now!  Awesome set of polarized shades!"
"OR";"The best thing is that it's very stable and does not slip.  It has silicone grippers and good connections at bowl.  Three stars because it is not comfortable.  It has a slight ridge right where thighs rest."
"OR";"I purchased this rug to go underneath my writing desk in my living room. I already had the area rug and door mat. It's looks very nice. The colors are beautiful."
"OR";"It took me a bit to get into but overall I liked the story. It is fast paced and a quick read. I think that if you want to try reading something from the sci-fi genre, this could be a decent book to start with.  I voluntarily reviewed an ARC of this book."
"OR";"A cute film, although entirely predictable. At least it wasn't about an action here from a comic book. Or the least effective monster, the zombie. Or maybe it would have been less predictable if zombies had been included. We'll never know."
"OR";"I love when King really gets inside the head of his character and this is an excellent example. I found it to be a bitter sweet tale, well told."
"OR";"This is the series that made me fall in love with MM books. Action pack, full of love and unfortunate heartbreak. The ranch guys are a family."
"OR";"These are excellent grappling tights. I have worn them 3-4 classes a week for the past several months without hardly a sign of wear. I will absolutely be buying this brand again."
"OR";"It's not bad but that is not strong so after using several times it's frustrated.
And i don't know the use of the white bar. There's also no tips.

Delivery is not bad,"
"OR";"I really like this book. I wish it wouldn't have ended this way. Just left me hanging for another great one I'm sure."
"OR";"Awesome product. so glad I bought this for my tank. I cleaned my tank the other day so easily thanks to this great product!! I'll be letting my friends with fish tanks know about this great product. I love the pump, no more sucking it to start the flow."
"OR";"I do a lot of cooking and baking and find that these small bowls help me prep my dishes. I particularly like having the different colours to help remind me of what ingredients are in which bowl."
"OR";"My 82 year old dad is so old school and he loves this key holder,he has had his old one for as long as I can remember and this one is perfect"
"OR";"The sound quality from these small ear bud are really terrific and high quality. you can hear the bass and the highs very crisp and clean. I will definitely recommend them."
"OR";"Made with quality materials, can fit a variety of different revolvers. It is adjustable so you can make sure your gun fits in snug. Holds 6 extra bullets on the front of holster. Quarter of the price of holsters at gun stores."
"OR";"I just received this book 10 minutes ago so I am unable to comment on how thoroughly it covers the basics. It appears to have a lot of detail on how to use the program.

However, be warned it is only a ""user"" guide, it has absolutely no ""tech"" info such as information on how to install or upgrade. I"
"OR";"These are great! They are air tight so much so that I would even put liquids in them. Also, they are dishwasher safe even though it didn't state that on the website."
"OR";"Oh god this is just to funny cause they are just junk.. I'm not sure what to feel it to  laugh or just trash them and call it a learning experience. There just paper weight toys.. Useless and junk.."
"OR";"There is some misleading language in the listing. In the beginning, I found it searching for waterproof cases. When you read further down the listing, you see that it is water resistant not waterproof. When I got the package, I noticed that there was a pressure release valve so it isn't waterproof."
"OR";"I love the shoe I order a 8 1/2 there where a lil to small then I order a 9 there where to big the shoes their are nice and comfortable love the red."
"OR";"These really are low to no odor bully sticks! My Golden Retriever loves them...very pleased with these since I have ordered other brands that do not live up to their claim of odor free. Will definitely continue to order Best for My Pets brand."
"OR";"Bike was easy to assemble--very compact and doesn't take up much space. Sensors work great and am able to adjust the resistance enough to get a good workout.  I was skeptical of the quality because the price was so reasonable but it has been perfect and I am very satisfied with my purchase."
"OR";"The material around the slap bracelets is fairly thin, and I do not believe I received any of the black poka dots in my package. I also only received one of the random zebra print bracelets, which of course is the one everyone wants."
"OR";"This router drops the signal on a consistent basis.  Too bad it started happening after my 30 days and I can't return it.  Plus one of the antenna's fell off during the initial installation"
"OR";"This was a little bit smaller than expected, but it works well for insulating both hot or cold food. I wish there were more styles and colors to choose from for my daughters."
"OR";"One cannot ask for a better product than this exercise pen.  Although I did not purchase this playpen for a puppy, it served its purpose exceptionally well for a mother cat and her five newborn kittens.  The purpose was to keep them isolated from my other cats while they were being cared for by momm"
"OR";"I was looking for something different and came across these while looking through the Amazon lists. They are larger than I expected, which is excellent! They were delivered quickly. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
"OR";"The nicest cable I have ever used, and cheap! The wires fabric texture, light weight, slimness, and strength are the best I have ever seen.

Buy one for your headphones if they have a 3.5mm input. Won't sound better, but it will feel better."
"OR";"It is now my go to litter for my cats.  I am traditioning away from the regular Tidy Cat clumping litter in the 35 lb buckets. Among the litter boxes I currently have are two identical litter boxes side by side, one with regular clumping litter and the other with the lightweight litter.  And my expe"
"OR";"Scarf is very soft and looks nice.  The color is more of an off white.  The butterflies are a little larger than I thought they would be from the picture but still very pretty.  I purchased this as a gift for Christmas so can't evaluate on how it drapes, washes, etc. which is why I only gave four st"
"OR";"I'm assuming it's supposed to be dried out?  My hermit crabs don't care too much for it,  however they crawl over it sometimes. It's not harming them so I'm giving it a good rating!"
"OR";"This is s very enjoyable read . I couldn't put it down. A bit of history combined with modern day interest.  A love a strange love affair that works."
"OR";"I am on my feet all day in a customer service job. These are very comfortable and I would buy more shoes like them again. I wear a size 8 and they fit perfectly."
"OR";"Smells good but no foam.  I put it in three different foaming dispensers and NO FOAM just gel oozing out.  Bummed me out but I can still wash my  hands with the gel.  Just wanted foam. Got the wrong thing I guess."
"OR";"This seems to work as advertised; it has helped me pick the USB cables that transfer current/voltage the best.  Hard to believe that there can be such a difference in cables.  It also showed me that my 15' USB extension drops no voltage - which was pretty amazing!"
"OR";"Enjoy this version,  a great companion in any Bible Study.  Gives a richness to understanding our Lord's precious Word to us. Love that it is on my Kindle as well."
"OR";"I got these to hang in one of the bathrooms with the litter box to get rid of the litter box odor. Hung both of them in the bathroom but did not get rid of the litter box odor."
"OR";"The first thing you notice is how lightweight these are -- does not feel like glass, feels more like plastic. They come in a white unmarked box with no branding, no care instructions, and no indication whether they are microwave safe. But apart from that they seem ok."
"OR";"When I tried to charge it, my laptop locked.  My Sony laptop (Vista OS) never locked before.  I managed to un-lock it with no apparent damage to the PC.  Obviously if you can't charge the Flip you can't use it."
"OR";"As a continuation of the Shadow Falls series, it does not disappoint. Great, fast paced book that keeps up the readers interest level and leaves us ready for more."
"OR";"This was free - thank goodness - or I would have been really put out.  I finished it even though I knew how it would end.  Just too much of the same dialog and way, way too many F words.  I love a good romance but this one did not feel real to me."
"OR";"This was a another great Olivia de Haviland movie.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys older movies with  with great scripts and unexpected turns."
"OR";"Robert Kirkman (Author), Jay Bonansinga (Author)

"OR";"Great sock - gives enough toe room so that at the end of the day my toes don't fee squashed. Four stars because they are difficult to get on."
"OR";"This is a rock solid, cheap, powerful wireless chipset, it has good support in Linux and windows. I've found it truly can hold 800 MBS on transfers."
"OR";"Really great movie. Burton is at his best and the rest of the actors are as well. A well-measured approach to a perceived real world look at what being a spy must be like- true to form. Not much James Bond like action here but that isn't what this movie is all about. This is a character study that a"
"OR";"I'm going to figure out how to return Bon Appetit for a credit...not really into cannibalism.  My husband also quit reading this one after a few pages."
"OR";"Exact replacement for OEM which only lasted 6 years before the plastic bits broke making it useless.  For the price of Toto toilets they should last life of the toilet!  Deducted one star for price and questionable life for this part."
"OR";"My dogs love this. We have been supplementing their raw diet with Petguard for yrs. now. No fleas either. My cat won't eat  w/out a little of it sprinkled on her food."
"OR";"I love this series.  The characters are well developed. I fell in love with both the male leads.  This book is a must read.  You will not feel cheated."
"OR";"This book is hot! Can you imagine that you can carry the child that can reunite a planet? The catch is you will have 3 mates, who happen to be identical triplets wowzers! This is a steamy novel, but the story is interesting and enjoyable. I found it hard to put down and read it in an afternoon."
"OR";"love it. charges fast. really fast. really really fast :) When plugged in, and in use (screen on), it still charges, unlike previous adapters i used that died on me on long drives even though they were plugged in and charging."
"OR";"4 stars

This story continues with us still trying to determine who the killer is.  As we watch Kate come into herself as a submissive, Jaxon is just the one to show her how much pleasure giving up control can be.  Their relationship continues to be steamy and hot.

Kate is falling fast for Jaxon.  "
"OR";"Love the book! The writer definitely didn't spend a whole lot of time on the back stories...straight to the neaty griddy! Read it in one day! Could not put the book down! The sex scenes were absolutely INCREDIBLE! The connections between the two of them was great!"
"OR";"We bought the matching Delta Soap Dispenser,RP71543RB, to the Cassidy High Rise Pull Down kitchen faucet - 9197-RB-DST.  Also bought the matching Dishwasher Air Gap.

The rubbed bronze finish was excellent and matched the Cassidy faucet.  The quality of construction was excellent.  The push down han"
"OR";"Mostly ok, but I never found a connector tip that fit snugly in my Compaq laptop.

In the end I used electrical tape to hold the tip in place."
"OR";"I owned a DVR from Replay and rented one from Time Warner Cable, and the TiVo is by far a better and more capable DVR than the two of them put together."
"OR";"I got a great deal when I ordered this item. In return, I'm making my honest and very reliable information about this queen bed sheet bedding set.

Normally before using a new set of sheets, I washed it first. But with this product I used right away without any hesitation. I can feel it's super soft"
"OR";"This is cute, the sugar packets are much thinner than this is so I just loaded it up with tea bags and set it next to my kureg. The color is solid black and it has a good weight to it."
"OR";"My kids loved playing with this float on the lake 4th of July weekend. It was easy to blow up (with an air compressor). They also enjoyed pretending scenarios just on the dock."
"OR";"Tin was awesome and looked Awesome, the cards were almost all trash for my deck. The price is worth it, but a warning that you might not get what you're after besides the cover card."
"OR";"I bought this so that i didn't have to buy a new stereo and it was the best decision i ever made! It has all the functions i expected it to have and more! Its easy to pair and not i have bluetooth functionality in all my cars!"
"OR";"Finally gave in and bought it. Takes all the guess work out. Just remember to store it dialed to lowest torque setting so you don't mess with the spring tension."
"OR";"Consider finding love when you weren't looking. This would definitely describe Chase and Rowan. Read to find out how this couple's  journey is going."
"OR";"The picture quality is nice, but the pieces come apart easily if my child bumps into them, and some of them are not exactly flat, so I have to push them down onto our flat hard wood floor."
"OR";"The fit was perfect and the shoe was well made although with no zipper they were a bit hard to remove.. I had to return them because it was not a shoe that fit with my individual style."
"OR";"Fascinating, creative, and challenging for my 5 and 7 years old grandsons. Even their dad enjoys ""playing"" with the robots and figuring new patterns for them to follow."
"OR";"My son loves silicone bracelets. He is a huge Ravens fan. I got these for a stocking stuffer for Christmas. They are nice quality and look exactly as pictured. They are thicker than most silicone bracelets. They are good for men to wear also. He really likes them."
"OR";"I am always surprised (not) that the Brits surpass the Americans in pathos and  intelligence with intelligent. humor to soften the violent  underbelly of such drama . I like Peter Davison very much, HE UNDERACTS TO PERFECTION"
"OR";"I prefer the sound of these to the A5+. I think the A5+ is over hyped compare to these. With these you can skip a sub woofer if you live in an apartment. I couldn't afford to keep these thou because the price is a factor to me"
"OR";"Very pleased with the quality thus far.  I washed and dried it according to instructions with no problems.  Personally, I like the thickness, it's not too fluffy & certainly not thin - just right IMO."
"OR";"This is an extremely well-crafted item that contains high quality materials.  The preciseness of this instruments lends it to making fine and accurate measurements.  Highly recommended."
"OR";"My dogs love this food. I had to stop using the auto feeder though because they would empty the whole thing to go after the peanut butter chunks."
"OR";"I was looking for a sturdy waterproof camera for my daughter. I wanted a good quality camera that could stand up to the mishaps of an eleven year old. She is in love with this camera because of all of the neat features that it has. She is able to take selfies with the frontal view of the camera allo"
"OR";"Flawless. As another user mentioned - add a GOGO Thick headband/sweatband on top and you could ride through hell and back and still keep your eyes dry."
"OR";"Fantastic spice rack! I attached 4 of these to the outer side of a kitchen cabinet, and now my spices are easy to find since I can see them all! These are very easy to mount to the cabinets with the adhesive."
"OR";"This really works nicely.  Now you can add fresh garlic to lots of dishes in just the right size - like granulated only fresh.  Not too hard to clean either."
"OR";"Perfect basketball net for the price. I put it down to 7' and dunk on it from time to time and it holds up fine. Even through the hot summer and cold winters."
"OR";"This boot is adorable, just as pictured. the material isn't too shiny or too fake looking. I am a tall girl though (5'10"") and i feel they might be a little too short in the shaft for me."
"OR";"Fits like i wanted it to.  The weather has been too good to use it since i received my order. I like the brand and have been pleased with other purchases i have made."
"OR";"Great quality, my mom wears hers almost every day & its still in great shape!  These necklaces are so cute & came right on time."
"OR";"It's good but the only thing i think is that it is a little difficult for a 3 year old to open the pretend powder compact and the bottom actually falls out sometimes."
"OR";"This sweater seems to be of good quality. The fabric is warm and soft. I like the drawstring that allows me to adjust the neckline. It is a snug fit as you can tell from the image. I am 5'5"" 125lbs...I got a medium and it fits well, wouldn't want it any smaller."
"OR";"They r blocks of big pourus sponge like the originals. Filters stuff I guess. I gave full stars because they r like the originals... So yeah."
"OR";"This is one of the most underrated Nicolas Cage (and Ron Perlman) movies ever.  If you like witch, supernatural, etc movies - this is one of the absolute best.  We watch it at least a couple times a year - one of which around Halloween always."
"OR";"this does not fit on the Jet saw, we had to rig it up with dryer hose to be able to hook it up to the dry vac :((  it's not 4"" it's 3 3/4"" which doesn't fit over the piece on the saw"
"OR";"I thought that my girl was gonna but you can't keep a Boss Bytch down. I have tho find out how the treaty of the crew is doing. What is legend gonna do.  Thanks for this, it had me crying,laughing, and hype all at ghee same time."
"OR";"Somehow I was doubtful. I wish this fork was in my hand decades ago. A work of art and science. It's so easy to cut things. If one hand is doing the work or you want to just make it easier, you will be thankful for this amazing, friendly fork. I promise."
"OR";"Good strong ice cream scoop with a nice comfortable handle grip and made a nice non pitting metal.  Very satisified with this product."
"OR";"OK show,  lead singer voice is past it's prime but worth watching. Aduio and picture are pretty good and the set list is good."
"OR";"Lightening fast, slick design.

Always been contented with Transcend products.

No complaints here.

Looking for a Ultra FAST USB 2.0 flash drive, then this is the one."
"OR";"Likely my LEAST favorite Daniel Silva -- the main character is going too predictable.  Mr. Silver is an excellent writer, but this novel lacks the quick pace, sharpness, & literary finesse he usually delivers."
"OR";"I just moved to a new city and was constantly getting lost so I wanted to buy an easy-to-use GPS unit.  I've never owned a GPS before so I can't compare this product to others, but I was able to make good use of this unit within minutes of taking it out of the box.  The touch display and menu naviga"
"OR";"Seems to be well made. Terminals are slightly cheap on the inside but look like they will hold up fine. Installed a Skar 12 inch shallow sub in mine with some poly fill on the sides and the setup pounds hard!"
"OR";"I have one indoor cat and this did nothing to reduce the flea problem! Finally with a comonation of Siphotrol Plus Fogger 6oz and 20 mule team borax sprinled on the rugs I got those little blood suckers!"
"OR";"SHORT LIFE! Buy another brand. By 15 months ALL of the 8 bulbs have died. Too late to get refund. Terrible rip off product."
"OR";"Each book in this series gets better and better. Although Alexis loses more time with her family, she learns more about her family history and her place in it. Her future was planned out before she was born, but Alexis has her own ideas for her future. War is coming. Who will win? Love or prophecy."
"OR";"glad the movies still are out so my girls can watch them. like i did as a younger girl. the movie was here fast or on time, nicely packaged. played well."
"OR";"These lights are great. Affordable and bright. Last awhile and can replace weak batteries. All of our bikes have them for late evening rides. Very quick easy install."
"OR";"This baby is great when paired with an indoor bike trainer and Vivoactive!
I can bike in the comfort of my own home and log miles on my Garmin connect account.
So far its been great. No issues with connectivity to my Vivoactive!

I would recommend and would buy again!"
"OR";"Very pretty....BUT...it's difficult to clean without streaking.  First you disinfect, then you use windex to remove streaks from cleaner.  Also....it shows every bum print!!!!!!!  :("
"OR";"Very cute story. Even though Harry is only there for a little while, you really connect with how hard it is for Pete to be without him. And I didn't know it was possible to burn toast!"
"OR";"Great book. I really loved the characters. There are lots and lots of twists and turns some you see coming and others you don't. Overall interesting."
"OR";"Gigantic ripoff. What arrived was a thin brown hooded cape in a plastic bag. NOTHING ELSE. No belt, no undershirt, no boot covers. Total waste of money."
"OR";"Apparently the fleas in my area (GA) are immune to Frontline and Advantage, but this one is really effective.  The cats hate the smell of it and its expensive, but it really kills all the fleas."
"OR";"I bought this for a my 7 year old nephew as a toy to exercise his creativity. He loves it and took to it right away. My brother had to help him set up the app and get him started but he used it successfully now he wants more stickbots to make more elaborate videos."
"OR";"Great deal.  However, these tended to jam in the magazines more than the official nerf darts. Would recommend paying the extra couple bucks for the official nerf darts."
"OR";"It do not hold hose Clamp enough
I mean too much gap head part
angle plier work a lot better, wasted money"
"OR";"These are cheap little party streamers. Some come broken, they often break, but the price is right and they usually last a few hours which is all that I need. I buy these every year for the same event. I wish they were a little more hardy but you get what you pay for and these aren't bad."
"OR";"So i bought this bag for my daughter 6th birthday...the bag is beautiful...but the strap got a flaw,the stitching loose...when i checked it was tacked with thread not stitched properly....i don't know what to do...she used it without the strap for her party..."
"OR";"Story is pretty good so far will have to read the rest to see if it continues.  Not my favorite line of story but all in all grabs at you so that you want to see what Charlie will do."
"OR";"My granddaughter was thrilled with the rose color. We never buy generic brands of rubber bands, only Loom rubber bands as we have learned that generic ones often break."
"OR";"For the price this is a nice piece of furniture,
Don't be a dope think you're getting Tiffany at Target prices.
It's just a lounger on the cheap.
It serves the purpose."
"OR";"I travel a lot for music festivals all over the United States and a few beyond. Sometimes this means flying even though it's not my favorite way to travel and sometimes I still need a tent when I get where I'm going. I'm not mad of crazy cash and also really believe that caring for the things I own "
"OR";"Well built piece of necessary equipment if one needs to plumb a door level ductwork etc. I should have bought the 5 point laser."
"OR";"I thought this book was better than Shopaholic to the Stars because it was a road trip through the beautiful western part of our country. Yes, some of the plots were stupid, especially the Vegas wedding scene. Is it as good as the first few in the series-no; it isn't the worst either."
"OR";"Love it!!  We got it for our boy who turned 3 because he really likes fraggle rock show and our 1 yearold little girl loves him too."
"OR";"I loved this one as much as the first in this series. Kane is your classic alpha and so yummy. Carolyn is a sweet character and I really enjoyed the she was written."
"OR";"What more can I say? If you know what cable you are looking for, and you are looking for this kind of cable, you will receive this kind of cable. These are just wires with their respective connectors.

Verdict: I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
"OR";"I loved the book all the way through.  I am a Seattle person so know the area too.  Read the Hotel on Bitter and Sweet and you will know more about this time in history and the conflicts."
"OR";"I thought the book was awesome and loved how the characters tied into the Bear Claw Security books. Once again Terry did a wonderful job about writing a love story about a shifter finding a mate. To make it better...he is a rock star! This is a must read story!"
"OR";"Loved this book as a kid!  So good to see (and sniff it) it reprinted!  Cute little book, that really sets off the Holiday season."
"OR";"My puppy is quite the chewer. This leash actually discourages him from chewing. He's grabbed it, but dropped it (perhaps because it isn't soft like a leather leash) and continues walking."
"OR";"My son will sometimes play with this ball and it talks back to him. He is 8 months old and isn't crawling yet so it is not as interesting for him as it could be if he were crawling after it but its something he can grow into."
"OR";"Good read nice opening for the next book which I have already completed. I have enjoyed every book I have read by Sharon  Cooper"
"OR";"best work gloves I have used. I did a large 1212 paver project and other yard stuff. other gloves I have used worn out way before. FYI when I get worn areas on fingers use duct tape and get even more wear."
"OR";"Loved this party decoration.  Large, beautiful colors and durable material.  Great all the way around. Fun party decoration which will catch attention."
"OR";"-This was a gripping book detailing the agonizing missed opportunities and ultimate painstaking detective work which resulted in solving  Adam Walsh's murder.  Could not put it down."
"OR";"This product is one that I have always known to be high quality and the one I recently received did not dissapoint in any way.  This is not only a very reliable roduct, the price is amazing."
"OR";"PNY 128GB 115 MB/sec Turbo Elite USB 3.0 Flash works well so far. The sliding mechanism is pretty good."
"OR";"This was a great book. Strong H and spunky h, just the way I like them. However, I would have liked more intrigue, with what the H had done for the crown. Spy stuff, espionage, etc. Anyway, overall, it was a Cinderella story and much enjoyed."
"OR";"soft, comfy, well made and true to size (6-9mo). My daughter is very small for her age (1yr) and this fit perfectly for her birthday party!"
"OR";"Great sturdy little chair. My granddaughter loves anything moose so this has been the perfect chair for her. Love that it locks when open so no fear of collapse."
"OR";"The book was great.  At the beginning of  the book it was confusing with the introduction of these characters.  At times I was lost with all of them.  Once they started to intertwine the book fell into place."
"OR";"The zipper continued to split from the get go...had to deal with it all night  as too late to send them back for a different pair.  The zipper was not lined up correctly- manufacturers defect apparently and I'm not sure if they are returnable now as I had to wear them that night :("
"OR";"I'm thinking C.DelSol just didn't switch displays on his laptop. By default laptops only have a video signal to the built-in screen.  There usually is a FN key combination to turn on the external video port."
"OR";"This thing is so much fun! We use this every year for our bonfire and everyone has a blast. I think is adults have more fun with this than the kids do. A must for any beach event."
"OR";"Original headphones, left channel went dead within first two months. Company replaced them immediately. Replacement set lasted about 10 months when the plastic piece connecting the bracket to the ear piece just broke.  Exploded right off my head!  Fixed it with superglue. Two months later the exact "
"OR";"This was a terrific, fast read packed with colorful characters and interesting history.  I especially loved the details about the World's Fair.  Lynch, a former newspaper man, sure did his research and it adds delightful authenticity to this gripping work."
"OR";"These are very nicely made. These are not originals, they are reprints which I believe is in the description. These are about 12"" square, with hangers already applied to the backs.
Disclaimer I received this set of 4 sea canvases at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"OR";"Staying motivated and boosting productivity are extremely important to achieve your goals in life. This book offers the best tips and techniques for being productive and achieving success in life."
"OR";"Love these Jockey socks! The red seam on the toes of the black socks & blue seam on the blue pairs eases my washing & my husband's dressing routine in the morning."
"OR";"I really loved this first book in the series. Tris is a true Hero and I love the chemistry that her and Four had. The story line gripped me and didn't let go. I was filled with action with a bit of romance. I cant wait to read the rest of the series."
"OR";"Standalone

Kayla has been in love with Talon for years. The problem is that he is dating her best friend Reagan. Wesley is in love with Reagan so Kayla and Wesley devise a plan to break them up so they can both get what they want. Things don't go the way that they planned."
"OR";"Simple mechanics with fast-flowing turns lead to quick games. Two ways to win, and a set of movement options shared by both players throughout play."
"OR";"I ordered this while waiting for a less expensive model to arrive from China. This unit is worth the price difference. Extremely well built. This one will last."
"OR";"If you are looking for a great bargain on UHF antenna this is your choice look no further buy two of these and either wire or solder them together and hook up a matching transformer that goes from double lead to coax and you are in business perfect crystal-clear reception."
"OR";"Only two side of mine are hemmed and I hand washed it before using as per some of the reviews because the dye does need to be rinsed. Outside of that it works for me and has held up so far."
"OR";"Not safety related..  my 4 year old likes call of duty and halo...  this has been added to his pretend box...  He thinks they are the coolest thing ever!!!!"
"OR";"This movie was good. They are talented dancers. The dance sequences could be better and more thorough. It is fairly consistent with Center Stage yet I prefer this ones filming."
"OR";"Our rat terrier loves chicken and she eats the grilled chicken every evening.  I'm picky about her food because she's diabetic, but she's eaten this food for several years and seems to be doing fine on it.  It's conveniently packaged, too."
"OR";"This is the second pair of these exact goggles that I have ordered this week that came with the mirrored coating very badly damaged. I returned the first pair that came and now I will be returning these. I am very disappointed."
"OR";"I want to buy this brand...but my dogs hate the lifesource bits.  They love the rest, but it is a mess picking up the lifesource bits they spit out on the floor."
"OR";"This is a nice hallway rug.  We use it together with the ""Rug Stop Non-Slip Indoor Rug Pad, Size: 2' x 8' Rug Pad"" and it has stayed put on our laminate floor very nicely."
"OR";"Love this bike light! Extremely bright and versatile. Easy charging. It only runs about 2 hours on full brightness though. Love that it is easy to apply and remove from my bike handle bar and use as an impromptu flash light."
"OR";"Great bag. Fits my thick mat, back roller, and all other stuff. I often cycle to yoga, so this is great for having everything in one bag."
"OR";"I went back and forth on this beam vs other brand balance beams that were $100 less expensive.  Finally decided that I would invest the extra cash and get this beam.

LOVE this beam.  Came in two packages.  Opened both the packages and just dropped the beam into the legs and voila, instant beam.  No"
"OR";"I am very happy with the purchase. I like that it has a glass top so it doesn't look so cheesy. My rings fits very easy into the slots and I have big and small rings."
"OR";"Loved the kilt in the writing.  I was able to feel what Lucy felt as she lie in her hospital bed. Her every thought conveyed what she could not say aloud."
"OR";"A short, well written read with a good plot and no cliff-hanger.  Although it is the 3rd in the series I found it easy to read as a standalone.  This book would appeal to those who enjoy paranormal Romance type stories.

I was gifted this book for an honest review."
"OR";"It fits my average-female-size hand well and serves as a favorite general cooking/prepping tool.  It keeps its' edge well.  Perhaps a bit over priced?"
"OR";"A brutally honest depiction of the holocaust. Beautifully written and emotionally riveting. I purchased the book after visiting the holocaust museum in Washington DC. A survivor who spoke to my students told them this was the most accurate depiction of the holocaust."
"OR";"Works well, stays lit all night. Mounting on a wood flag pole took modifying the included mounts. Otherwise a good product, hope it lasts longer than 12 months in the Las Vegas sun."
"OR";"Came quickly and just in time for the event.  Medium fit my 10 year old daughter perfectly and they are soft and hold up well in the wash."
"OR";"Bought this for my son who is in the Scouts and we do a lot of winter camping here in the Rockies of Colorado. Stays nice and cozy when temp's get into the low teens and below. Easy to pack up in a compression bag, a little heavy for a 12 year old but he is a Scout."
"OR";"A great toy in principle - it holds up in the wash, and there are lots of ways for your baby to play with it.  However, my son would play with this for 1 min tops before tossing it aside.  At least for my son, if it doesn't make lights or noise, fuggedaboudit."
"OR";"perfect design. I redid my bathroom and have these on a shelf. I have 12 of them. Would be perfect for the pantry as well. Highly recommend if you are looking to get organized"
"OR";"How can you go wrong for $1.00  apiece($2.00 for 2 pack) delivered. They do what they're supposed to. Maglite brand. The original bulbs lasted over 10 years, hope these do too."
"OR";"My Chocolate Lab. went through this guy a little too fast. I'd go up on the Tuffy scale to a higher number (less easy to destroy) but the 9's are all such boring shapes. I guess that's why they last so long? It's boring to the dog too?"
"OR";"Our 4 year old Batman loving nephew was very excited with this Batman book.  The presentation and cover are very exciting - great book and gift!"
"OR";"This was a quick, smutty read that makes me want to read the rest of the series!  I guess that's the point of short stories/novellas -- in that case, mission accomplished!"
"OR";"Used these once and they are relative crap. Why you ask? Because that big, solid panel in the middle turns these into fans, which creates a burst of air that moves bugs (especially the little guys) out of harm's way. Windy Hill, indeed."
"OR";"I want more, I need more! Really different, well thought out. Well done, a lot of potential, I see a series based on this. I hope I am right."
"OR";"i love this case it has a nice black finish and all components fit comfortably inside with room to spare. It also has ample room for cooling and extras."
"OR";"I blasted through all 7 of these really fast. They were creative, fun and great to read. Nicely plotted and well executed. Great for an airplane or beach."
"OR";"Great black mini skirt, thick fabric, not cheap and wears very well.  Washes well and such easy care.  Throw it on and go."
"OR";"Suze is now working at a resort this summer as a babysitter to eight year old Jack Slater. He is really shy until Suze teaches him about what he is, a mediator. His hot older brother Paul is Suze's age, and he keeps pestering Suze into going out with him. Of course, she doesnt want to because she is"
"OR";"Way smaller then expected...is already.assemble  so I just have to suck it up. My kid hates it..oh well ..he's only 8 months let see if he change his mind...I had to leave open one area to make room for him because it was too small for him just sitting inside."
"OR";"I read that they ran small so I ordered a large because I like lots of room. Glad I did! I'm 5'7"" and 140lb and I had the length and roominess I wanted. They fit as I expected after combing through tons of reviews, but I'd definitely recommend buying a size up."
"OR";"For the price, they are OK. You have to make some modifications. Consider these, from the factory, as partially assembled correctly. First, you have to grab a pair of pliers and flatten the hoop where all the lines come out the top. If you don't, they get snagged. Hard to describe, but you will know"
"OR";"Although the 3.5mm plug has to be changed this switching power supply is just right for the Elecraft KX3 transceiver offering sufficient current and voltage to run the unit and charge the batteries."
"OR";"SanDisk 16 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-016G (Bulk Packaging) - Class 2 is a premium product, worth beyond their price ... therefore it is highly recommended for their utility"
"OR";"Avoid it. The top portion is made of plastic. No matter how I adjust, it will not stay leveled. You will need to get a separate ballhead to mount your camera. The mounting screw is too recessed. You will need to carry a screwdriver to mount a camera."
"OR";"If I could I would give it more stars for ingenuity and thought put in to it. It's only 8 volts so not sure what to expect. Have not tried a long screw yet."
"OR";"It was a top quality product but it was not compatible with my system so I had to return make sure to check I did but got poor information. Still it was a good product."
"OR";"Pretty much exactly what the title says.  Not really great on fight scene choreography.  Mostly just running from and trying to duck the flying guillotines."
"OR";"My bunny basically litter trained herself. All I did was sit this in her cage, put her hay rack directly above it and her food bowl in the corner of the pan. Super easy to clean. Love that my girl isn't sitting in her urine and feces."
"OR";"Replaced a single pole switch with this product. High ceiling made it difficult to control fan light and speeds. This upgrade was simple to install resulting in a compact and modern look compared to the single switch it replaced. I changed all the switches with Lutron products (i.e., dimmer switches"
"OR";"I bought this for 1yr old expecting it to be a bit beyond his skill and interest level but I had one when I was little and loved it.  Much to my surprise he loves it ... granted it's all just scribbles right now but he's really enjoying it and it makes a great travel toy.  Great buy."
"OR";"Only used as soon as we got it so far. It seemed to calm down the digging one of our dogs was doing.  Will keep using to see if it solves the problem"
"OR";"I had to move my scope mount so it would position correctly but it has caught every spent brass cartridge and no jams. Easy zipper to open and dump the brass out. Perfect."
"OR";"Fan of the series loved every last movie. Had fun reliving my childhood. Can't wait for the next pokemon movie on blu-ray"
"OR";"Good short story. Catches you up on an interesting couple, opens the door to new characters. All while experiencing the nostalgia and mixed emotions that come with the holidays."
"OR";"I thought these were going to Stretch like my other 505's and while they do slightly stretch they are not nearly as comfortable as my store bought versions.  I can barely raise my leg to a 70 degree angle.  My other 505's will let me bring my knee to my chest."
"OR";"This stuff works great for cleaning off feet. My dogs have allergies and this product is excellent to wipe off their toes after they come inside from playing on the grass."
"OR";"Great item. Doesn't work for all cats but that doesn't mean the product is bad. Some of my cats don't like catnip. Just know your cats."
"OR";"The book snagged me in the beginning, however it lost its spark half way through. I had expected a little more gusto since I have read other books by Dodd."
"OR";"I'm extremely pleased with this product! The cover fit my 18"" x 51"" ironing board perfectly, was easy to install, and reasonably priced."
"OR";"This little thing is so much better than any multitool pliers I've ever used.  I stopped carrying a multitool because they are usually just a collection of inferior tools.  These small pliers pack a punch.  Built tough, and I use them all the time."
"OR";"Just as described, this little penguin is a perfect worry-free plush toy for baby.  I do not have to worry about any buttons, glass eyes, plastic pieces, etc, being chewed off, and the smaller size is safe, comforting, and also easy for transport.  My baby loves it."
"OR";"A waste of money. Has come apart after only a few months. Wasted money. I will go for a real tripod now. Angry that Amazon doesn't stand behind the products sold."
"OR";"This was a fun, sexy continuation in this series. The conflict, tension, and sexual attraction worked perfectly with Cash and Billie. I can't wait for the next one."
"OR";"Unit works, but the cover seem to big for my High sierra pack, so it don't fit in flush.
The value works good, no spills."
"OR";"Works ok. It's a little sensitive. If you push the button sometimes it gets stuck and the bell is stuck on repeat. The same thing happens when I shut the door sometimes."
"OR";"I love these.  they take the zap out of the iPad that was keeping me up at night.
once I used these, I slept happily.

I actually bought more to keep them at each place I use my iPad."
"OR";"Love the game, but it looked like it came to us used. The box was all damaged and there was tape everywhere. Gave as a gift and was kinda embarrassed."
"OR";"Chase is a successful athlete whose hockey career is ended prematurely by an accident and is recuperating in his hometown.  His depressing situation has one ray of sunlight - Mari, the quiet bartender of Danny's."
"OR";"Very well made.  Great leather quality.  Took me some time to figure out how to attach it though.  Finally found a Youtube video that showed how"
"OR";"they are ok, can't handle as much as I believe they say they will, but I'm no expert, just wanted a real powerful system to replace the Onkyo speakers I already had."
"OR";"I didn't realize that it was a CD when I bought it, but I had heard such good reviews from my pen pal I just had to get it to check it out.
Tao of Pooh was a great read, I'm still trying to understand this on another level. Over all though, I don't regret buying it."
"OR";"AUDIO book: Engrossing true story. Especially for us living in OKC. The narrator, deserves special recognition. I can't decide if she was overacting; hated the mostly whisprey dialoge, or if she really had a great story-teller voice."
"OR";"Excellent adjustable, three dot sight set.  Easy to adjust and visibility at night is excellent.  Expensive, but arguable worth the price in sight accuracy."
"OR";"Again I say Dame Judi is one of the greats.  I love this show, there are no sexual undertones or dirty jokes through out the show, and it is quite refreshing.  I ordered this on a Friday, and it was here on Monday.  You can't ask for better service than that.  The DVD's are in perfect shape and I am"
"OR";"The product arrived as expected. Did not contact the seller but the delivery was fast. It is in a good quality and I'd recommend it. The product has good quality and it is very cool."
"OR";"Easy to setup, communicates with Insteon parts effortlessly.  Does get glitchy every now and then when configuring other switches (suddenly had 3 switches responding to 1 switch, ended up unpairing all of them and starting from scratch, then they worked correctly)"
"OR";"The only travel mug I have ever owned that truly does not leak, and my coffee stays hot.  Goes through the dishwasher with no apparent problems (so many that I have owned were hand wash or top rack safe only).  This mug is a winner!"
"OR";"Powerful enough for a small aquarium or for extra circulation but it doesn't pivot & have a lot of flexibility to change where it flows as it'll just pop out of its suction mount easily."
"OR";"I grew up watching these TV shows. They were much better than anything we have to suffer through now. These had very little ""Social Justice"" crap in them. These TV shows were fun and entertaining without any ridiculously presented PC. For a buck-ninety-nine the episodes are worth it."
"OR";"Glad to finally replace the DVD version I had that never looked better then my original VHS! I have yet to watch it, its not close enough to Christmas yet!"
"OR";"This is one of the draw backs of the Olympus Brand digital camera.  The XD cards are more expensive than the SD cards and made me kind of shy away from the Olympus products.  This adapter makes it very affordable for picture storage."
"OR";"Disappointed as was my grandson. Described as a real tablet however there is no browser and therefore he is unable to access anything other than the provided apps. Unable to access other educational sites. Basically just an expensive toy."
"OR";"bought this for my 4 grandsons, never saw them have so much fun.  It says for 6+, my grand kids are 5, 4, and twins that are 3.  They can use this without any problem.  This one of the best things I have bought for them.,  Smiles and giggles all the time."
"OR";"I love this book. It is so far my favorite series. But Cedric dies at the end. I am going to read the next ones inn the series."
"OR";"Best price, best value anywhere on the web. Way cheaper then buying locally. Highly recommended. Helps keep your cats healthy."
"OR";"CHicken Fajita is one of my favorite mountain house flavors. My rule with all mountain house is that I make sure the water is super hot and I don't put the recommended amount in. I also leave it in the bag lnger than recommended."
"OR";"HOT!!  This is all in Aaron's POV and let me tell you, if you didn't move him to the top of your book boyfriend list before, he is definitely on top now!  I just love the interaction between the characters.  I do have one complaint though.. it was too short!!  Can't wait to hear more from Emma Hart!"
"OR";"Polished Green Jade 13 mm Slip-On Bangle Bracelet, 7.5"" Totally wrong size? Not sure how it was measured, both were to small? Returned no questions, no hassles!"
"OR";"Too much going on.  Diana is a weak, pathetic female for a lead character. Central relationship is dysfunctional, and borderline abusive, Diana is constantly making excuses for Matthew's horrible behavior.
This book was hard to finish."
"OR";"I put 2 of these batteries through one full charge and discharge cycle as soon as I received them. On heavy and extended usage, they last at least as long as the Sony original and correctly report the number of minutes remaining."
"OR";"Very high quality and great price. I recommend them however you need to start when your dog is young-- we bought to distract our older dog when he barks at every little thing the clicker doesn't phase him. But the product is really high quality and we did keep them"
"OR";"This was a great story. Somehow the description was different than what I thought the story to be about but nonetheless this was a great read. Looking forward to part two."
"OR";"I like the shoes. Most of my shoes are a size 8, but this was uncomfortable. Fit me more like a 7 1/2 would. Quality was very good, however."
"OR";"Lovely. I learned the hard way that the outside is glass. Not used to that on an LED. Very elegant light and look to fixture. These are in the powder room for all the visitors to see."
"OR";"Perfect for a less than 2 year old grandson who likes to play by the child's tool bench with his older brother.  Lightweight and safe tools."
"OR";"I enjoyed reading this book as a follow up to "" me before you"".  I enjoy her style of writing and didn't want to put the book down until I finished.  I have picked up several more books by Jojo Moyes to read in the immediate future.  I always appreciate finding an author I enjoy reading."
"OR";"Any drummer who wants to learn great technique or merely enjoy great drumming will appreciate this video. It showcases Buddy's technique across a full spectrum of sets, including brushwork on ""Brushstokes"".

One of the highlights of this DVD is a bonus sequence of ""Green Dolphin Street"" (from 1972) "
"OR";"I bought this as a second filter for my 40 gallon RES tank... it has made quite a difference! I think it works better than the other brands canister filter!"
"OR";"Hey, that is a cliff hanger!!! Really enjoyed reading this novella. Just when I was getting really caught up it ends. I have definitely got to get part 2!!!!"
"OR";"OMG!!!!!  This ballerina doll is beyond precious.  It even looks better in person than it did online.  The perfect size, so soft, and her little outfit is perfect.  My 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loved it.  She takes it to ballerina class with her."
"OR";"S K heats this story up with each segment that comes. This one is no different from the other. The characters and storyline remain as exciting and strong as from the beginning. Loving it more and more as it goes on. 4."
"OR";"Really enjoyed the first 3 episodes of season 1 I have watched.  It is an Adult only film, but if you like Sci Fi.  This is a good one."
"OR";"Cons:

I've tried to find glass containers that fit this bag, and have been unsuccessful except for the 2 cup Pyrex that only fits in the bottom ""shelf""

the side net pockets are useless when the bottle holders are being used- too tight

all the inner pockets are netting and pretty flat. would have "
"OR";"A little to big and wide. I have a normal mens 10 foot. Go to 9.5 if your in my shoes..get it? But seriously go with a 9.5. Also they fit a little loose around the ankles. These shoes are designed for work and they aren't the most comfortable for work."
"OR";"These are fantastic shoes -- very lightweight and comfortable.  They have a mesh-like top, so they're breathable, too.  These are the most comfortable walking shoes I've found in years, and I'm delighted with them."
"OR";"Another home run for all us lone freaks out here. Good to know there are other people that actually use their brain to get to reality. Not so alone anymore!"
"OR";"Good inexpensive tape - was imported from China - I consider tape measures to be consumable so no issues have used this for a while and its showing its age as expected - would recommend."
"OR";"The backpack is as advertised. I don't know about the long term but I've used it a couple of times the last 2 months and I have no complaints. I wouldn't get this bag if my laptop was over 15.4 in. My fits snug but any bigger and I think I would have had a problem"
"OR";"The pan is just the right size to hold 4 pieces of bread when making French Toast.  The no stick feature is great making clean up a snap.  The aluminum body is rigid and does *not* warp or twist while cooking.  I highly recommend it."
"OR";"I got this item as a gift for someone and she loved it! The watch looks great and works great! Definitely buy this watch!"
"OR";"I have been using this drive for my mac book pro with the hard drive tray for about 6 months and it has worked flawless. The increase of the speed of the computer was very notorious."
"OR";"I liked what I've read so far. Pretty good intro to the Porter family. Can't wait to read the full book."
"OR";"Very handy for tightenning accessories and components. Looks to be well made. I like the fact that it splits in two parts which makes it easier to work with."
"OR";"Excellent replacement tubes for florescent fixtures.  These will save about half the energy I use on my traditional florescent light.  I plan to purchase additional LED tubes."
"OR";"Interesting dragon that makes noise and has movable parts. The wings were torn up quickly, but not due to how it's made. Sister got ahold of scissors and cut the wings."
"OR";"Beautiful quality product. I gave a 3-star rating only because these lights have to be wired into power source and can NOT be used with a cord and adapter as the description says. Even the instructions in the box say can't be used with cord. Buy it only if you can hard wire it in."
"OR";"Very valuable information on staying alive when things go wrong.  Digest the info slowly don't just peruse it.  It could save your life if you ever need it."
"OR";"Peppermint shrimp didn't care a lick about our aiptasia. This stuff knocks them out immediately. Wow. It's also neat to watch. They implode on themselves and don't come back."
"OR";"This is a great beanie.

Pro: Warm, soft, fit very snug (I have a larger head), nice and bright without reflecting.

Con: Absorbs any/all precipitation. Once I waterproof it with some spray I'll update after
the next large snow."
"OR";"** spoiler alert ** I liked the first Jack Reacher book but Die Trying was a mess. ***Warning Spoilers***. Very little worked for me in this book. A kidnapped FBI agent keeps escaping from an escape proof room and they keep just putting her back in it. What?!? Reacher keeps escaping, keeps getting c"
"OR";"It is a documentary.  Interesting if you are a WWII buff.  It is amazing that he was able to escape trial and punishment for his war crimes.  With today's information systems and technology he would not have gotten away."
"OR";"I'm pretty handy, but this was impossible to use, and you'll live in mortal fear it may retract quick enough to slice open your hand. To be clear, it didn't cut me, but it retracts fast enough I believe it could."
"OR";"Love the characters, very real. Enjoy the connection from book to book. The last bit had all the pieces come together- but left you wondering"
"OR";"My cat hates this thing, cheaply constructed Velcro edges are sharp on corners,
and cat played with for 30 seconds the hid it from me never to find again.
Garbage."
"OR";"Reading Georgette Heyer is always always such a pleasure-so entertaining-such clever coversations-and quirky circumstances which always come together for a great read."
"OR";"First read from Emma Hart and it will not be my last. This book was just the pick me up I need after reading a lot of MC books. Mia and her friends were downright hilarious and the running commentary that Mia kept having in her head had me laughing out loud. West and his filthy delicious mouth was t"
"OR";"The cats love this wand.  They like the Mylar sparkly ones better but the problem with them is I worry about them pulling out the streamers and they can choke on it.  This seems to be more sturdy."
"OR";"""Void Star"" by JP Yager is IMHO an amaterurish, attempt to write an adult mainstream sci/fi adventure story. The prose is simplistic and aggravating. Not my cup of tea so I stopped reading at the end of the 3rd chapter..."
"OR";"Wore these socks while hiking the Long Trail in VT. They were very comfortable and stay kept my feet toasty, even while wet. Only complaint is that they take a long time to dry (even on the outside of pack in direct sun light)."
"OR";"Lots of big ideas to chew on in this book, but I wish the multitudes of plot lines and characters would have converged at some point, instead of simply trailing off. One other nitpick ... the author tried too TANJ hard at coining new words."
"OR";"So much easier than filling balloons one by one.  Only complaint is that if the water balloons aren't used right away, they can lose the water that's in them."
"OR";"bought this for the media pc in my bedroom.  the only thing I don't like about it is the touch pad, but I don't want to have to deal with trying to use a mouse in bed..."
"OR";"I love this vent fan. The only sound I hear is the sound of moving air. I did replace an existing fan and I replaced it on the ceiling side. I installed additional framing and mounted it from below. Yes. It was a lot more work than mounting it from above but, it certainly can be done."
"OR";"Great card. Thanks to the review posted by other users, I already knew it will work with Linux. Plugged it in and I was surfing in a minute. Great replacement for the on-board NIC that went bad in my laptop. No need to install any drivers or re-boot in Linux."
"OR";"Not the highest quality by any means. It works and looks good. The corners are like blades that cut the legs of anyone unfortunate enough to walk too close. We had to buy padded bumpers to put on the front corners to avoid more pain and bloodshed."
"OR";"Love these bottles. Had a problem one was broken and the seller was easy to deal and replaced the broken bottle no problem. I would definitely buy again"
"OR";"This is a good book but to short. I wanted to find our a little more. But it has love, friendships ,and magic . No action but then it is a Christmas story. So get it and enjoy."
"OR";"Very imprecisely. You have to try very hard to make it work on the screen. Well, I guess the tablet was not designed to be written on anyway so the pen is an OK product to me."
"OR";"This is the only earbud that fits my particular aural cavities, and the sleek controls have become a welcome addition to my daily travel. I dread the day when my last pair breaks !"
"OR";"I really didn't read anything earth shattering in this book.  I would say save your money, just cut out sugar and flour.  So easy."
"OR";"Wow so glad this popped up to rate! I forgot what I had that I liked, for the past year have had a struggle finding one as solid (not wobbly, not easy to break, truly one handed) ... And now I can finally return the latest piece of crap I got and get this again!!"
"OR";"It works.  I give it 4 stars - it's fine for my 65lb dog (I use it as a ramp between the dock and the boat).  Good quality, not great."
"OR";"The oldest got this as a Christmas present. He was so excited he was out in the blistering cold, sick riding down the driveway Christmas day. Mom & Dad like to ride it too ^_^"
"OR";"Enjoyed reading about the travels but she is kinda a ho. That gets exhausting. Every man that gets near her excites her and bores me. But overall an interesting read."
"OR";"Works fine.  A note for Techs,  this cable is thin.  If you cut the cable a RJ-45 crimps on but its a bit loose.  It did work fine in the end, but really shouldn't be cut for custom lengths.  I really should have just used bulk cable."
"OR";"This was the best camera i have ever had to date! Stop reading reviews and just get it, you will not regret it a bit. once i started using it i find i can't put it down. i can't wait to continue to build my lens collections just so i can continue to amaze myself with this masterpiece! LOVE IT!"
"OR";"I read all four books and was drawn in from book one! Really enjoyed the story line and would recommend them to my friends and family."
"OR";"This is the best kitten food ever: even my vet recommended it. Ninja got her name from those nasty, stealthy, killer silent farts. After starting her on this food: no more stink!

And I don't have to carry the bag, the price is less than in the store."
"OR";"My toddler loves playing with this. There is one piece that is very fragile so I don't let her play with it but its a great learning tool and it was exactly what I was looking for. The pieces are large and not paper so they don't get ruined if a little wet here and there. Great product I definitely "
"OR";"Manufacturer will not honor their warranty.  My thermostat gave out in less than a month, and they won't do anything about it.  I sure wish I had bought it on Amazon instead of the HVAC thief that sold it to me."
"OR";"Amazon wanted me to rate this product but I have not had the time to use it in the installation of the Boss subwoofer.  The star rating is only because the computer system requires one.  Hope to install the subwoofer with the wiring harness over the July 4th weekend."
"OR";"This is a mediocre yet tolerable romantic comedy. It tries to be like Romancing the Stone but it falls short. The acting isn't too great, the characters cheesy and the plot silly but it's watchable.

I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it n"
"OR";"Kids play and play with this whole line....VERY much worth it!!  It is an expensive toy especially when buying several but no regrets,  Start your collection today...."
"OR";"I cant say the food was bad, but it sinks fast not slow.  my Monster fish Did not take to it.  it sank really fast and they are not bottom feeders.  So i returned it.  now i have a frontosa who eats sinking foood and i want to know if he will eat it."
"OR";"You can make plans and decide what your path in life will be.  That is all well and good, but... sometimes life has other plans for you and no matter how stubborn you are about staying in the path you have chosen, you will need to adapt and accept that nothing in life is perfect.  It is out of those"
"OR";"I'm pretty impressed with this guy. Light weight but strong. Comfortable in my hand. Less fatigue than using my 1/2"" drive. Disassembled a while v8 with it. It handled everything except the head bolts. Hopefully it holds up because I like this thing."
"OR";"Read instructions, test, and forget it.
I have these units AND the fire / C M combo detectors both.
This stuff is deadly odorless and silent.
Do not let you home be without IF you have gas heat."
"OR";"This held my attention from start to finish. I want to go back and chew through all the information again. Riveting. Reading  from this perspective is interesting, my pop was at Pearl Harbor when it was bombed. I grew up hearing things from the American perspective. Sigh."
"OR";"I've already returned this case. The bottom piece would not say snapped on at all. The keyboard cover was great and the colors of the case were vibrant and really flashy. If the bottom piece was fixed, this case would be great. But as it is? Save your money."
"OR";"These small ice packs are used in my children's insulated  lunch box (pottery barn kids). I keep their lunch in a stainless steel container and the ice packs remained cOld. No complaints! Would buy again!"
"OR";"I really like this design.  Much easier that the older style where you had to reach down and move the device to hold the door open.  To close all you do is push the door open just a bit more and the door closes automatically. Nice when you are carrying something."
"OR";"A great family saga spanning the 20th century in Southern Italy. A great summer read.reminds me of James Mitchner weaving history with the lives of families."
"OR";"Loved this story. I am very eager to find out what is so special about Gwynne. And my mouth is watering to read about this ritual.  very well written story Carina."
"OR";"The forest scenes wash out in lighted areas and lack 1080p resolution. This production is probably made with cameras 2-3 years older than 2010 productions."
"OR";"Love these shorts, but like all Asics I've bought, there is no vanity sizing and you can expect them to run a shade on the small side.

I love the stretchy waistband, and the legs are wide enough to work with my curvy thighs.  A little short in back, but not indecently so."
"OR";"Its not overly loud and some people you may pass might not even realize you rang a bell.

If I had to do it all over, I'd buy one of those annoying bells I remember as a kid."
"OR";"It is a good hub & can turn on/off 3 ports at a time if don't need to use especially I have many printers & external hard drives."
"OR";"I was very skeptical on purchasing this for my 2 cats but once I placed it into the patio I was sold.  My cats and I both love it.  Living in florida and having the a/c on this definitely helps when my cats want to go on the balcony.  Absolutely love the door addition.  Very sturdy and easy to insta"
"OR";"I love the idea that my daughter can stir without making a gigantic mess. The lid was difficult to get on at first, but it seems to work OK now."
"OR";"Replaced Logitech keyboard which quit working, with this mouse button and a virtual keyboard.  Still working even after kids used it to play catch."
"OR";"An absolutely singularly great book!  An intelligent, thoroughly enjoyable read.  If you are one of the unfortunate few that have not yet enjoyed this book, order it now!"
"OR";"These are great.  I sterted out with a pair of the larger ones and ended up buying another pair of the large ones and a pair of these.  I keep them on the front of all my sheds.  They come on when I'm walking up or leaving the shed and stay on for 15 seconds or so.  Plenty bright."
"OR";"Got this for the guest room in my son's house, since I am the guest usually.  Perfect for me.  Inexpensive and can see the time any time I wake up without my glasses."
"OR";"This will work exactly as I wanted it to. Nice and easy. I woud have liked a couple more keys, or some way to order more keys, but I'm still pleased"
"OR";"This was a cute book but felt very rushed.  Nico and Kat meet and instantly fall in love.  His family seems very accepting for someone who just appearred in their life.  I was glad that she didn't forget her goals and education simply because she fell in love."
"OR";"I bought this as my 'training' strobe.  It works pretty good for portraits and product pictures.
The only minus is that you only get full and half setting but it is easily overcome by moving the strobe or reducing exposure in camera (F-stop or shutter speed)"
"OR";"This has a different look at the situation.  As the military is all volunteer, far fewer young men are faced with this contradiction of hour philosophy.  I cannot understand the country's thrill for military conflicts."
"OR";"This specific type of lid by Contigo has never leaked on us - even after years of use and dishwashing.  Looks good and functions good."
"OR";"These shoes were for my fiance. They look great and are comfortable however after not too much wear, the elastic in the back has started to pull or bunch up on the top. That is the only fault with them."
"OR";"Does slice thinly for coleslaw.  My husband loves using it for slicing.  Makes life much easier.  Easy to clean, then ready to use again."
"OR";"I read Wolf's Run a while back and was glad to see that this was getting turned into a series. Having rooted for Cassie and Yeagar before, I really was rooting against the villain in this book. All in all I enjoyed the mystery, suspense, and intrigue. Really looking forward to part 3!"
"OR";"Unfortunately my dog didn't like these much. He ate one, which didn't have any apparent effect, and then wasn't interested. I couldn't blame him- they smelled medicinal."
"OR";"Have always used Oceanic for my water changes and was a little worried about purchasing through the mail...but it is the same quality as what I purchase from the local fish store, and costs less!"
"OR";"Already read about 15 Clussler books and this one is just the beginning of so many of his books.  Once you start this book, you just read till the end."
"OR";"Warm white does not mean clear. I was hoping this string would match the clear LED lights on the rest of my house, but while they are not as ""blueish"" as the soft white LED's they still have a tiny blue hue to them. Aside from that they were fine."
"OR";"I like the overall size. It fits a card table with plenty of room around it. It is nice that it comes with a large paper picture of the puzzle."
"OR";"I have both the front and rear (red) light. They are very bright, even in daylight. The lights are compact and the narrow shape lessens the clutter on the front or rear of a bike. My rides are usually less than an hour, and I recharge every other time."
"OR";"Great light! It's bright and light weight.  I love that it's adjustable so I can focus the beam right in front of my feet, or farther down the road if needed."
"OR";"What'so not to like?  Well made, variable speed, easy chuck lock and 3 hr battery charge all at a low low price."
"OR";"Just an additional note.  There's both an American version and an British version.  The British version of course uses English terminology such as ""I'll tell my mummy"" in place of mommy.  There are several differences along this line."
"OR";"Although this opener does not separate the top from the sides, it seems to cut quite well without shards of metal in the can. Sometimes it has trouble grabbing the can and it has refused to open a few."
"OR";"Maybe I can't complain because it was a cheap polo. I was hoping to start buying polos directly online instead of the store. But the quality and look of the polo are bad enough that I don't plan to ever wear it... lesson learned."
"OR";"Great movie. I love old Egypt in Sci-fi. This movie has a very cool bad guy and continues the tradition of examining the politics of being different."
"OR";"It was so much fun re-visiting all the Assassin couples!!! There's a chapter for each couple, so we can see what they're up to for the holidays. As usual, there are sappy, funny, and sexy moments throughout!"
"OR";"Using it as part of my Religious Ed. 7th grad class.  A wonderful and very moving video.  Not perfect according to the Gospels but captures the ""Spirit"" of Christ's message."
"OR";"Tabatha loves these!  They even get her back from neighbors yard over 9' Wall.  And from everywhere else in house or yard + most importantly:  Stops her from biting our toes"
"OR";"Buggy when setting up m. 2 wound up buying a pcie m. 2 extension card which defeated the purpose of this board. A simple bios update would fix it but a this is a dying socket type don't hold your breath."
"OR";"As of Jul/9/2009, The Legend of Billie Jean has unfortunatly not been released on dvd. Dvd listings for new and used copies are bootlegs. If you are very desperate for a copy, order at your own risk. This ""import"" was not a legit version else where."
"OR";"They are solidly built and are very comfortable to me. However, I'm disappointed with the sound quality.

"OR";"My two year old liked that she could wipe mud off but it returns in second which frustrated her. Also I think they fill with water and can get mood inside (haven't looked yet). She played with them first day but hasn't since."
"OR";"I am impressed with each and every 'Reproduction Barbie Doll' that I own. I bought one for each of my four granddaughters, with the hopes of keeping this iconic legend alive. Barbie is educational because she encourages socialization and etiquette through role play. Of course, you need more than jus"
"OR";"One domino had a bit of a wood knot in it - but not a problem in how they work, the feel of the finish. or our enjoyment -purely cosmetic.  Both my children - and I - love to play with these!"
"OR";"This works great for my aluminum Picatinny rail but not my Magpul Weaver plastic which I had intended it for. Seems to be heavy duty steel and looks nice."
"OR";"I was hoping that I could pin my baseball jersey to the inside. There is no felt to pin the jersey down and had to use the hanger...not a fan of that look. However, the frame is nice and well made. I wold buy this again if I wanted the jersey to hang at the top."
"OR";"Beagle doesn't like when it goes over her head but it is comfy and doesn't rub her raw anywhere. Other harnesses she was always trying to wiggle out of. When she takes off after a smell and reaches the end of the leash, the harness protects her from being jerked back."
"OR";"We love lego and star wars. This is our least favorite lego set. It is very fragile and frustrating to put together

Disappointed in this set. And we are rarely disappointed with lego."
"OR";"You have to like reading this period to enjoy the book.  If you like Jane Austen stories you'll probably like the books.  I read this one because the two film adaptations I've seen end so differently.  I wanted to see how Jane ended it."
"OR";"Put on a 12GA pump shotgun. Held zero for the 25 test rounds.
Dot is nice and bright. Have not tested outdoors in sunny conditions but I would imagine the dot would still be pretty visible."
"OR";"Rebuilt my PC from the ground up and I absolutely love this board for my new Intel 4880k build. Plenty of slots to for expansion and fit into my case perfectly"
"OR";"I use these headphones with an MP3 player on daily walks. They are comfortable, stay in place because of a snug fit, and sound good on all types of material, especially audio books. And, of course, you can hardly beat the low price; so I can unhesitatingly recommend them."
"OR";"My 7 year old brother really enjoy playing with these, but i think the articulation could be better... other than that, really good action figures."
"OR";"LOVE this movie ! Great british cast with 2 Dames (Maggie and Judi) plus top notch locations that look stunning. Its like a vacation .So sit back ,put your feet up and be transported to India and another life!"
"OR";"I don't see how we've been able to watch this as many times as we have since purchasing it. But honestly, it's entertaining as heck and doesn't make me want to rupture my ear drums when my toddler wants to watch it every single day."
"OR";"If you love to read and need a little pick me up, then I suggest you read this book. It would make a great lunchtime read!!"
"OR";"very nice but a little stiff.  been spending some time with hand lotion & elbow grease trying to soften it up.  looks real good on my puppy"
"OR";"Sometimes a person ends up being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Enjoyable whodunit from the beginning to the end.  A book that I couldn't put down till the end."
"OR";"Arnold is always fun to watch and while not as outstanding as Terminator 1, it is a satisfying end to the trilogy and makes for a fun afternoon watching all three during a cold winter afternoon with some hot chocolate and a large bowl of popcorn."
"OR";"The specs are pretty self-explanatory. It's fast and has 8 threads, and you can make it faster if you want.  Doesn't come with a CPU cooler like the cheap ones do."
"OR";"We had a lot of sanding to resurface a our deck, and I already had an older 5"" inch sander from Bosch.  The 6 inch, obviously removes more material but I also find it way more pleasant to use with the vibration dampening system."
"OR";"Love all of Cynthia Breeding's books.  Well thought out, and interesting.  Have picked up a lot about Scotland and Ireland and their history from reading these books."
"OR";"This short story focuses again on Luke and Simon and serves to show just how strong and lasting their love is.

""I've loved you since the first moment you kissed me to shut me up. Nasty tactic, as I can't object when I've got a mouthful of your tongue. There has only ever been you since that moment."
"OR";"Bought this for my 8 year old daughter. The neck is not straight, it will not tune, and it is going back the same day it was delivered. Don't waste your time and money."
"OR";"I couldn't get enough of Colin Mitchell, a college journalism student, who blames himself for the death of a fellow student and who goes on to solve her mysterious death and brings down the college president at the same time. I just loved the wacky characters!"
"OR";"I ordered a half size bigger after reading the reviews here.  They fit perfectly.  Very nicely cushy for my daily 5-7 mile walks.  Had been having minor knee and back pain which seem to be much better since I got these shoes.  Very satisfied."
"OR";"At this price point, these stands are sturdy, spring loaded, beefy, strong and have a decent case.  They are not small but are considerably lighter than other brands.  They are definitely a bargain!"
"OR";"Excellent stone to compliment my library of stones.  I have several for getting the knives to a decent edge and this one to really work the final polish on my blades.  The rubber base is really grippy and holds the stone to the counter when I am using it."
"OR";"I like the product it is pretty sturdy it works well on the carpet but the portion for the hardwood floor doesn't slide as much as you would want"
"OR";"My futaba striped out after 5 months so I put this Savox servo in my rc8.2e buggy. I turned it on, turned left, turned right and pop! The tabs broke off."
"OR";"First off, this thing is big. If you don't have an application that requires a big, long spout, this is probably not a good choice for you. I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't re"
"OR";"I admit to being a dog show addict, but this series should capture mystery lovers who wouldn't know a St Bernard from a Pekingese. Harbert explains enough about the ins and outs of the dog world for the reader to understand the plot without burying it in jargon. And the plot has enough suspense to k"
"OR";"They appear to be thicker than the other ones i have, they are built solidly, perhaps these are made out of just glass where as the others i have may be made out of crystal? in any case they do work well"
"OR";"i followed the other reviews and they were right i normally fit in a large but i ordered a medium and it fits me very well i like this vest because it is very stylish but simple at the same time"
"OR";"Great cord. Easy to carry, east to use, bends but doesn't fold, so no damage yet. The color makes it easy to find."
"OR";"Second Coming is sequel to First Fruits - amazing paranormal romance. It is just as great as first book from this series ;)

Second Coming is more packed with action and magic. Tension was escalating with every single page. Parsley and Jesse were faced with their biggest enemy - Patrick (I wish I co"
"OR";"I got this movie for a great price and it was something that was on my daughter's Christmas wish. I can't wait for her to open it and watch it whenever she wants to."
"OR";"Well-made, full brushes.  I just started using them, but they feel like they will hold their bristles for years.  Also have a nice, solid set of bristles."
"OR";"These ideas sound awesome, but the fact that I can't see any finalised project just frustrates me! DIY projects should be more explanatory and not just only words, specially for someone who's not familiar with these crafts."
"OR";"Perfect gift for my 6 year old. She came as expect and packaged perfectly with the accessories. I brought another one for her as well. They both are winners."
"OR";"I haven't worn them on the course yet but they fit pretty true to Adidas golf shoes I've had in the past. I really like the look."
"OR";"Great training shoe. Light, airy, fun to use because of the disc. My second Puma disc shoes. My first one broke after several years of use, the disc system worked perfectly past the life of the shoe."
"OR";"On a multiple item order, item was received a week prior than all other items order shipped under the same property.  It is little oversensitive on the mouse movement.  I'm sure there is a sensitivity adjustment but haven't spent the time to look for it yet."
"OR";"Eh, it's just okay. Sometimes it punches, and sometimes it doesn't. Very finicky. I'd recommend just using a manual center punch and a hammer until you're ready to spend money on something from Starrett or another brand like that."
"OR";"Love it. In my retirement days I use it daily with my W10 Dell Venue 8 Pro for emails, browsing and Youtubes. It sure beats using the on-screen keyboard. For ""heavy duty"" full-size applications I use my laptop."
"OR";"I enjoyed this book on many levels:  I learned so much about our aging infrastructure,I learned about atT types of relationships and I learned about a wonderful part of our country."
"OR";"My 6.5 year old uses these for soccer twice a week.  He hated the velcro straps that hold shin guards to his legs.  These solved the problem and hold his shin guards firmly in place beneath his socks."
"OR";"I used my sisters while on vacation and fell in love! I'm a big water drinker so it's nice having a cup where it stays cold!!' Will be purchasing more for the family!"
"OR";"Put this on my Skill Circular Saw, huge difference from the old blade.  Cuts much cleaner and way faster.  Makes it easier to cut a straight line.  Over all great improvement and much cheaper than what I would have gotten locally."
"OR";"Great watch! I LOVE the LARGE DISPLAY. Lots of features, nice large buttons and a light that works perfectly at night."
"OR";"Can not go wrong with Elvis. Found this item and previous others with ease.very good price,selection. Ordering was easy. Very fast delivery.add this to collection"
"OR";"you do not need kindling or paper to start a fire with these.  Just break off two pieces, put them between some wood (or bio bricks) and light it.  Great product.  I bought beginning of the season and still have 3/4 of a box left.  Great value, great price"
"OR";"I hate to see the rating on this film misrepresented so I have to rate it.  Aside from the lousy picture and sound, the movie stinks.  Hard to believe both John Sturges and Charles Bronson were involved in this schlup, if that's even a word..."
"OR";"Although the context of this story was hard to handle, yet I couldn't wait to get back to reading the next day. The author made you see and feel the character in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a great book."
"OR";"This looks like an okay shoe. I usually wear 990 womens 10. 5B or 10. 5D (whichever I can find in a bright color). These Leadville mens 8. 5D were too narrow across the ball of the foot."
"OR";"A wonderful story for anyone coping with a tragedy or just trying to understand the meaning of their own life. I would love to see this as a required reading for religious education."
"OR";"Wasn't too impressed with this, it was broken and I needed to return it. I did not reorder because o just wasn't impressed with the material or it. I figured if it was broken so easily when it supposed to be sturdy and strong there was no sense and re-ordering it."
"OR";"If you have ever taken an exercise class that has totally kicked your butt & you are looking to get that kind of workout at home - this is it!!  When you are done you know that you just did a serious work out. It's approximately 48 minutes of constant cardio that includes an active aerobic warm up a"
"OR";"This thing is the bomb!! Easy to use (with two people), and does the trick thoroughly. My vent was super clogged (and I knew that going in to the cleaning process). We proceeded slowly, doing only the top ten feet first, then proceeding down to the next sections. So, we probably lowered it down a to"
"OR";"this is great  on my back  i put it on  wall  and  roll  it up and down  bending  my knees to small  for me  to lay on floor  to do  make sure before on wall  that it does not hurt your paint  on wall"
"OR";"Doesn't look anything like this photo.  Very thin copper wire which arrives tightly wound and becomes immediately, irretrievably tangled when unwinding it.  Could be just me."
"OR";"I love this!  The only part of owning a cat that I HATED, is now just a mere chore.  If this ever brakes or needs replacement for some other unforeseen reason, I will be re-ordering as quickly as possible!"
"OR";"They were about 2in short length and the waist was an inch or two to small. I found Wranglers that were cheaper and fit perfect ( i ordered the exact same size)"
"OR";"These are great shower shoes. This is my second time in Afghanistan and they work for me every time. I use them every single day here and I never have any issues."
"OR";"Simple game, kids like it because it says ""dude perfect"".  They use the beanies to do trick shots and don't bother with playing the actual game."
"OR";"This is one of the funniest and most quotable movies of all-time. John Goodman is the best he's ever been and Jeff Bridges has a career-defining role as ""The Dude"". If you have a pulse, you need to see this. WAY too many classic scenes to ignore this masterpiece."
"OR";"My dogs absolutely LOVE these treats. They are veterinarian recommended and very healthy. Made in the USA these are human grade. Excellent product. I highly recommend."
"OR";"Sight tool was well made but needed some padding to not allow the direct contact with pistol slide.  It allowed the slide go get scuffed."
"OR";"I used one of these to work on pc's so I didn't have to hold a flash light while screwing in parts. It's also great for walking the dog."
"OR";"Really pretty and comfortable.  I love it when metals are mixed like this and the elastic makes it adjustable without having to fiddle with a clasp.  VERY happy with mine!"
"OR";"Bruce Willis did his best work here and the rest of the cast was excellent as well. As good as this film is, it's unfortunate that all M. Night's subsequent work was unfavorably compared to it.  I can recommend ""Unbreakable""(also starring Willis) as the same kind of mystery with a ""drop jaw"" ending."
"OR";"The shirt I received looks like it has been through a wash cycle at a thrift store!!
Nothing like the picture. Boxy, not feminine, and an ugly wash color."
"OR";"Way way way better than I thought they would be. Good weight, sharp blade and cool graphic. Perfect gift for a zombie lover!!"
"OR";"Yes, this mat is very expensive, but it was very important to my mother that there were no suction cups.  This mat prevents my dad from slipping in the tub, so it was worth the cost.  If Mom and Dad are happy, I am happy."
"OR";"It was a pretty good flick but not as good as the original.  Hit Girl has grown up a bit as has Kick Ass and I think they were better characters when they were younger."
"OR";"This is an interesting adventure about a team who goes to Russia to free an innocent child caught in the middle of a mafia and political mess.  Great story line."
"OR";"These are okay, but they still slip down my heel.
I let my daughter wear them with her sperry's (she has bigger feet than me) a size 9 women's and she really like them!"
"OR";"Nick Nolte's performance is outstanding and very, very interesting plot. Thoroughly enjoyable film all suspense story lovers would enjoy. Highly recommend."
"OR";"A gift for my son from out of state. He loves it and the fit was perfect for him. The sweatshirt seems to be well made, great stitching, and the colors are bright."
"OR";"Picture does not do it justice. It's long and metal ( not plastic ) and it was easy to install. I have a garden tub that would splash water on the sides when filling. This solved the problem."
"OR";"These are a great purchase for the money. These are quality bags, and I have had my share of bags over the years. I would definitely recommend these. They also look nice."
"OR";"Item is necessary if you have the Downmat and want to use the pump bag to inflate it. I really feel they are charging way to much at $10 for this piece. It should be included for free or only a couple dollars max. It is well made and works great but way over priced."
"OR";"Trash, but trash with a certain pedigree. Ordinarily Stuart Whitman should not be compared with the can't take your eyes off them greats and there's nothing here to make you think otherwise, but in spite of it all it does possess a certain something...Janet Leigh? Maybe."
"OR";"Arrived early, in perfect condition & the story kept MDH & I on the edge of our seats b/c the cast was so endearing & the villains so bad they were good to hiss at!"
"OR";"Very good, has not warped under the constant exposure and torture of Florida's sun. Rolls smoothly and has not developed flat spots even though my boat sits on it for extended periods."
"OR";"This movie is my favorite ever. The scenery is beautiful, the acting is extraordinary, the narration is poetic. Babette's feast is not some ""movie with a message"" otherwise it wouldn't be any good. But it's so real and poignant that much truth can be seen in it, spiritual truth and insights which sh"
"OR";"I use this with my Intex Mariner4, really improves handling and tracking, a must have foe bass fisherman in windy plains reservoirs.

You won't regret buying this."
"OR";"Best thing about this glove is the material.. it has a stretchy feel to it and it breaths great. really helps on hot days when you can feel your hands sweat, always gave me a confident grip. Would buy again but I wish it had a ball marker on the cuff."
"OR";"Fit well for 6-7 years old boy (on the small size). I tried other model and brands at Big 5 but this is the best."
"OR";"Really thought this candle would be much larger, but it's lasted quite a long time considering how small it is. Obsessed with the way it smells."
"OR";"This was easy to assemble. Instructions were clear. The parts were in great condition and nothing was damaged. It looks awesome once it's all set up and it's a great place for all your makeup."
"OR";"Holds it's edge for about a week of my standard usage.  Easy to sharpen.  Good blade shape.  After about a year, the tension bar has started to rattle when open."
"OR";"Soooooo adorable!! My puppy looks so cute!!! Very nice product!! Came all wrapped up nice and FAST customer service!!! I will purchase more!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!"
"OR";"I'm an accidental collector of these since Amazon has made it possible to buy all of my toy purchases for Christmas from my couch. I have to say this one is my favorite. It is very soft and snuggly. My only complaint is mine is a grumpy bear and does not have the same sweet face as the one in the pi"
"OR";"Working through training with one of our dogs and this is perfect. Flexible plastic makes it a bit more comfortable and it's easy to get on and off. With training methods our dog is getting used to it more and tolerating it on for longer periods of time. Also about $10 cheaper from Amazon than Petco"
"OR";"Cat is fierce for someone that is not ""worldly"".  Looking forward to Jace opening up more about his issues.  So much more to learn and will anxiously await book 2"
"OR";"Interesting how this didn't stay around long after its initial run.  I suppose it's because this is a thinker film ... & exposes in part ... how well we are being manipulated.  Should be required viewing"
"OR";"This Optoma projector died after 2 years. I've been replacing 2 lamp bulbs in a year and now the color wheel went bad.  The noise of this projector is annoying and horrible. Don't waste your money on this projector."
"OR";"Ignore Julian Fellowes condescending rhetoric and explanation and enjoy a lively and very funny adaptation of Trollope. Tom Hollander is wonderfully restrained and witty as the good doctor."
"OR";"Excellent workmanship. the choice of sizes was a surprise. My husband is hard to fit and we were able to find  his size. He`s very pleased with his new workpants."
"OR";"Interesting premise which moves fluidly thru place and time but almost too fluidly. The ending feels as if there was a deadline to meet. I give it a 6 out of 10"
"OR";"I ordered a small, I'm 5'1. They're roomy pants and somewhat long. I have too roll up the bottoms so I don't step on them! However, the material is nice!"
"OR";"Very nice quality and its adorable! Made both snowman and Santa. It wants me to say more! Well, this is way better than those cheap flimsy ones!"
"OR";"Fun teen-type movie, but difficult to follow the story line.  No thrilling moments like the ones typically associated with vampire movies."
"OR";"This was a great purchase for my grandson who loves the movie cars. He was turning 3 and all his friends loved the decorations and especially the pinata. It was a nice size, not too big or small and the kids loved it. It took quite a few whacks to open it so all the kids got a turn."
"OR";"Fits perfectly on my Bianchi Duty Belt.  Glock comes out of the holster without pulling your pants up, or having to use your other hand to hold the holster in place!"
"OR";"Slow in starting,difficult to understand-- especially the dialogue--in the beginning; but gradually drawing the viewer more and more into the multifaceted plot. In the end the very human characterizations reward the viewer with a very  satisfactory sense of resolution."
"OR";"really good juicer. We have had to for over a month now and have no problems at all. It does extract a lot of the pulp, so if you don't like that, you might want a different option, but other than that, no complaint!"
"OR";"My 2. 5-year-old is OBSESSED with this toy and has been using it nonstop for days. She wants to take it everywhere she goes so the handle really comes in. handy."
"OR";"I'd give it 5 stars, but it doesn't come with a 1/2 Tablespoon measure, which would be very helpful.  Since there's 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon, you have to use 2 different spoons to get a 1/2 Tbsp measure."
"OR";"This clamp works great until you strap on a bigger flash. It struggles a bit with the 580ex II but works great with the 430ex series."
"OR";"These are neither a good nor a bad glove; you just need to understand what you're ordering.  This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that.  You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your h"
"OR";"The microphone works well, people tell me.  However, I think they skimped on the ear piece part.  It doesn't reproduce clearly enough for me."
"OR";"Guarding Nadia is a fast fun Roddick read full of gorgeous men and sex with the little mystery thrown in.

The bonus scenes of Cade, Trevor and Riley are fabulous. you get all caught up on what's been going on in their life"
"OR";"A Highlander's Obsession is a great story!!! I absolutely loved it! I want my own Creighton!!! (what woman wouldn't?) This book kept me enthralled from beginning to end. Definitely going on my to be re-read book list!
I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
"OR";"A great pump for my fountain.....I had purchased a smaller one for my fountain; but it wasn't strong enough; this one really pumps the water up through
 the fountain..."
"OR";"Awesome toolset here. Purchased it to have all wrenches and sockets in one place and this does the job perfectly, not to mention the great brand name. Highly recommended."
"OR";"Not a good range of smaller comb sizes and I think the sizes marked on them run a little longer or taller however you want to look at it."
"OR";"built may rivet builds, decided to try a screw build. I won't do another. Rivets are easy enough, don't see a benefit to a screwbuild."
"OR";"Very nice.  They are heavy duty.  Note:  I am not a climber.  I use them for attaching car keys to my backpack, and running ropes through for various suspension, or load bearing applications."
"OR";"Good tool! Takes the same battery pack as my other 18V Makita tools, which is a Very Good Thing. Well-balanced, strong, no excess vibration. Love it."
"OR";"This is a great quality product and fits in nicely with our kitchen. It's a sturdy product that holds a ton of stuff and does the job! Would recommend."
"OR";"Got these as a requirement as a part of my bridesmaid outfit (worn with long black chiffon dress).  Looked SO cute, and very comfy!  Chucks are a classic for a reason."
"OR";"Alpha werewolf Yeager stumbles upon his mate during a biker get together in a small town.  Theres just one problem: his mates just a child.  So he resigns himself to waiting for her to grow up.  Years later, he returns to claim her, only to find that his arch-enemy has also discovered his mate and w"
"OR";"think pump i would not recommend...it broke with in a week ..hard to set up....falls apart...waste of money machineland dropped the ball on this one"
"OR";"I watched most of the seasons and got hooked and was hoping to find the complete set so I can watch it again and see the parts I missed  Thank goodness I found this item."
"OR";"Very disappointed. Im a big moonstone fan and was very much looking forward to receiving this pair. The earrings don't match and one of them appears to be cracked. This design has a beautiful name but the quality is very poor. If I lived in USA, Id have returned them."
"OR";"Paula is an American Icon and National Treasure.  It's sad that the media has portrayed her as this villain but the truth is she has overcome so many obstacles in her career that it is really remarkable the success she has had.  I could watch her all day!  Love you Paula! #TeamPaula"
"OR";"LOVE LOVE this belt!! Instantly my favorite one. Perfect fit (cut to size) and adjustable every pair of pants."
"OR";"Fascinating story!  I purchased the book  because I planned to see the musical ""Hamilton"" when it came to Chicago and wanted to know about his founding father.  He is the only one of our founding fathers who was not elected president and did not own slaves.  His life is amazing. The book is very wel"
"OR";"This is a beautiful story about seeing the inner beauty of a person. All too often people only see the outward appearance overlooking what truly is important . Beauty comes from the heart , not fancy clothing nor painted faces. My kind of reading ."
"OR";"Buy in big box store, Save Receipt! Bought dec 1, 2014 from BBB, and it is still working !
Yes, it is cheap for the money, and because the parts are all plastic you must treat it delicately,
I used only a 12 oz bottle for starters. YOU MUST USE DISTILLED WATER so no mineral build up occurs.  Yes, pu"
"OR";"After reading all the comments I went ahead and purchased it. And sure enough, the surface is slippery, and the ball is not circumferenced completely, but it is working once I got used to it."
"OR";"The Ruin Trilogy comes to a spectacular conclusion!  If you read the first two books, don't miss this one!  This brings it all together!  Excellent!"
"OR";"I didn't know anything about this movie. Saw that Angelina Jolie directed or produced it - this was a solid and intriguing movie. True story which made it more appealing. There wasn't a lot of violence but it kept you on the edge of your seat. I love happy endings."
"OR";"Makes carrying treats easy. I got the large one, and can put about 2 dozen small milk-bone type treats in it at a time. The clip popped off once, but that was my fault.  I walk dogs for a shelter and before this I put my treats in a pocket - very messy."
"OR";"Just enough humor to keep one laughing but plenty of red herrings for the mystery buff.  And then there is the ""Lucy/Ethel"" moment.  That one is either a twist on Lucy and Ethel and their antics or Stephanie and Lulu in the Plum series.  Worth the read."
"OR";"I bought one of these because I was afraid the 18' kit would be just a bit short.  I was right.  With this plus the 18' kit, it's perfect.
As a side note, in case you're wondering, it screws onto the Rutland brush rods perfectly."
"OR";"This sharpening system worked perfectly for me out of the box.  The directions were slim, but this is a common system with information on the web about it.  I've found it to be heavy duty, with nice welds, paint and locking mechanisms.  For the price I think it is an excellent value."
"OR";"If you like chick flicks, you'll like this one.  It's not anything fabulously wonderful to write about, but it's a good movie on a rainy, boring day!"
"OR";"My 3 grandsons are trying to get all the teenage mutant ninja turtles action figures, and one gets what they pay for when it comes to action figures."
"OR";"This item is very well-made and very effective as a reflective safety garment. The construction is solid, and all the straps are adjustable. I love how it looks and fits. Am very happy to have it in white and gray (vs. the neon pink, green, and blue versions also available)."
"OR";"I gave this to my 21-month-old and she loves it. She has become fascinated with digging and playing in the dirt lately and immediately knew what to do with this. The toys seem well made."
"OR";"Everything went without a hitch with the seller but I just wish this mat was bigger than what it is.  Probably my fault for not paying attention to the size but I hate when I get out of the tub and I stand on it and it doesn't cover all the water dripping off of me on the mat.  Other than that I lik"
"OR";"I've ordered a number of frames from ArtToFrames, both from the manufacturer and from Amazon.  The make a good frame at a good price.  I would order more as needed."
"OR";"Lots of drama in this story. Plenty of twists and turns but could do without some of the characters. Overall it was interesting, just busy. It is worth reading though."
"OR";"Decent idea.. but it doesn't add enough to gameplay. Almost always end up only playing the original version. Takes longer and setup is more complex."
"OR";"My router was at one end of the house and my PC at the other. I ran this the length of the basement. I was getting 25-40 bps and with this, I am getting a consistent 866 bps. Fantastic."
"OR";"Solid holster. Fits my Sig SP2022 9mm perfectly. Only gripe is that the holster comes a little bit loose from the paddle/belt loop attachment sometimes, but it only takes a second to tighten up again. Everything else is great though!"
"OR";"Ours came with 4 baby kittens.
But the mommy cat doesn't look exactly as pictured, ours  just looks odd.
But my daughter loves it anyhow."
"OR";"Absolutely beautiful. An important and inspiring message we need to share with each new generation. This book and the movie both make life better for everyone."
"OR";"..... but my kitties won't eat much of it.

I like to give my fur babies the best food I can afford, so I tried this.  Turns out that to get them to eat it I have to mix it with the cheap gravy-laden stuff or they sample it and then leave the bulk of it on the plate.

Sigh."
"OR";"HORRIBLY STUPID GAME. IF YOU ENJOY TALKING ABOUT POOP AND FARTS THEN GO AHEAD AND BUY IT-IF NOT.... WELL DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY THEN!!!"
"OR";"A good continuation of the series, action packed and exciting. Full of the realistic twists and turns of plans going to heck that we've come to expect."
"OR";"Price is awesome, saves me so much money this way.  Service was fast and professional.  This size will last a while, even w/my large herd."
"OR";"If you have not seen this movie you really are missing out. George C. Scott is masterful in this rendition and would recommend this to anyone. I saw this version when I was in my teens and was so pleased to be able to find it on Amazon. Their vendors are so prompt in their delivery and returns are a"
"OR";"Pros:
Quick, Perfect cup of coffee everytime

Cons:
Noisy
Pricey
Annoying if trying to make coffee using K-cups for multiple people. (None of the cons are signficant to me, but might be to someone else."
"OR";"I have ordered a ton of these as baby gifts and children's gifts for my almost 2 y.o. son and all the birthdays we will be invited to! The Jellycat Bashful series is completely adorable and extremely soft, but I believe the bunnies are hands-down the cutest/softest!"
"OR";"I am on a roll right now. I have to read every book back to back. They are so good, they are hard to resist. Short and spicy and Mae is such a match maker."
"OR";"Loved the characters, loved the story, loved the sweet romance.  Innocence personified in its entirety.  Can't wait to read more from this author."
"OR";"Beautiful picture!  I like puzzles hard and this one fit the bill pretty much.  Love Ravensburger puzzles and this wasn't a disappointment."
"OR";"Be warned...I can only review this on the first 30 minutes and then I had to turn it off. Horrifyingly slow and boring. The lead actor who lives in his car? Devin Ratray?  Why????? Watching grass grow had more life. I just couldn't waste anymore of my life on this."
"OR";"This lens cleaner didn't work at all... My other car's CD rom skips a few seconds of each track and I was hoping this will clean the dust and thus fix it, but nope, it didn't do that at all!"
"OR";"DVD arrived on the date it was issued for the public, in perfect condition.
I now have all of the Harry Potter movies and love them as much as I loved reading the books."
"OR";"Netrunner is a great, great game. Lots of strategic depth, endless replayability, and plenty of expansion content to help keep your decks fresh. However, it's important to note that Netrunner is a CARD game (Living Card Game to be specific), not a boardgame (the contents of this box are basically so"
"OR";"Works well, so far, and is quite pretty. Nice, subtle, deep burgundy purple band, very easy to read face. Elegant."
"OR";"it fits my tab 10.1, my boyfriend's tab 7.0, my iphone, his galaxy sl, fits anything you want to stand. It is adjustable, and adjustments are small hence you can make small adjustment to fit your viewing angle perfectly."
"OR";"This has been very useful to me. I tossed out my netgear wireless router, and replaced it with a raspberry pi. This unit lets me have a single plug for the raspberry pi, since it can power it, and other peripherals such as a wireless access point."
"OR";"Excellent story based in England during WWII that runs the gamete of emotions. It deals with a young girl and her life. I enjoyed watching it and I could watch it again."
"OR";"Nice grip and weight on these darts. Case has plenty of room for spare tips and flights.  I chose to go with shorter snub tips and rarely if ever do i bend or break one.  Would buy this brand again in a heartbeat."
"OR";"Nice size balloon. It is still inflated 3 weeks later. He kids loved playing with it. Overall I am happy with the quality of the product."
"OR";"I like these cable ties, because you can make them the size that you need. Be careful not to put them too tight. I did once, & the end broke off when I tried to untie it. They fit tight."
"OR";"I got this from Toys R Us, not from amazon.
It's ok...doesn't have a good ""rock"" to it. My only complaint is my daughter's (20 months) foot gets stuck in the gap under the horses belly/legs when it's on the ""rocking"" setting. I'll post a photo later."
"OR";"Perfect!  It's exactly what I wanted and he loves it.  My husband is a very large muscular man, 6 ft 265 lbs and this necklace fits him great; even with a thick neck and large traps!  Not too delicate to snap and not too large to be gansta'!  Perfect!"
"OR";"Great color. Brighter than incandescent.  Far less power consumption than incandescent.  Not sure about durability,  time will tell. Happy with the purchase and performance."
"OR";"This  is NOT a favorite Elvis picture. His character was too irresponsible. Blue Hawaii is a much better movie. I got the feeling that Hawaiian tourism was the goal here."
"OR";"My mini dachshunds managed to rip the head open within half an hour, along with chew the ears off and start on the legs. Thankfully it was cheap, so I'm not annoyed. It does say on the packet it isn't for strong chewers."
"OR";"Works perfectly for me. It fits my shoes and my husband's. Roomy. Love it. Saves a lot of space in our closet and this is important when you live in small apparent."
"OR";"It is lightweight... which is JUST what I wanted and I could not believe the color... it matches my aqua bedspread to a ""T"".  A little bigger than I thought it was going to be but... that just means that my cats can lay on it while I lay under it."
"OR";"Fit my TP-1a perfectly.
This is as good quality as the original ones that came with my (then) $150 headset (2009).
Great stuff for the price!"
"OR";"These look amazing!!  But  know that cutting them can be difficult.  But the appearance is outstanding and they STICK!!  Have had up over a year & still look great.  Get lots of compliments."
"OR";"Wow these are sleek and sexy perfectly weighty and have sizes i've never gotten in a set before.  I've never paid quite so much for a set of measuring spoons before but i'm glad i did these are perfection. function and beauty collide."
"OR";"I liked the idea that a Bruja may live next door.  The characters made you like them so much that it made the next events more horrifying."
"OR";"This piece does not come with the ring light. This holds my camera in the center of the ring light and allows for easy adjusting. This is a must have for ring light photographers."
"OR";"This LPS is so adorable! My daughters were so excited to add her to their collection. Good quality, delivered fast and no problems. Would recommend for and LPS lover"
"OR";"Used product for several weeks and saw no difference in nitrates going down, they did however go up and I switched to purigen and now my nitrates are going back down"
"OR";"This is one of 3 ""must have"" books for writers.  Stephen King is amazing--and not just as a horror writer.  This book is engaging and memorable in more ways than one."
"OR";"Like this trackman & for the price it is great once you get use to it it will become an old friend at first I was not sure I liked it but now I like it allot"
"OR";"Great fit! Great quality. So incredibly comfortable. I get terrible blisters from any other brand of shoes but NEVER from Saucony. I can walk and run for miles in these and my feet are fine at the end. The mesh is great for keeping them aired out so they never smell either."
"OR";"I would recommend this to any one. I have read many of his books checked out the library as to purchase any they re so good the cost on one is to high for my budget."
"OR";"No carry handle as some others noted. Spend a little more and buy a better battery box. Get the Minn Kota battery box."
"OR";"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having n"
"OR";"Update: 3/15/2017
They worked so good I ordered another set. Battery life is fantastic !

I was not expecting much from these lights and bought because they looked neat.
Was pleasantly surprised with both the operation and how well they work. Put them in outside garden and they work great !"
"OR";"Was disappointed; found it boring.  But then I've become addicted to Breaking Bad, fast action/violence/suspense,
so this might have spoiled me for John Adams more slow plot development."
"OR";"Very creaky.  Not a good buy.  The slats kept falling out because they weren't cut long enough.  You will probably have to get a metal platform base in addition to this frame.  I did.  Better to buy something else that's actually solid wood."
"OR";"My granddaughter (6 yoa) thought this was great to keep her dolls and accessories safe from her pet mutt who likes to chew doll toes and heads."
"OR";"Originally released in 1934 as ""Babes in Toyland,"" this film is far and away the best of the Laurel & Hardy operettas.  The evil Barnaby (Henry Brandon), wants to force the lovely Bo-Beep (Charlotte Henry) to marry him.  Towards this end Barnaby banishes Bo-Beep's beloved Tom-Tom (Felix Knight) and "
"OR";"It was OK, less impressive than Lamb or Fool by C Moore. Slow start and not as funny as his other works. Had bits of charm and wit that redeemed it though not enough for me to recommend spending money on it. Worth reading if borrowed from a friend."
"OR";"The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up rope"
"OR";"Love love love this cooler. My gf and I use this for our picnics in the summer. It makes a great lil table for stuff when sitting down."
"OR";"It's a good little clock, it is not too bright. You get what you pay for, however it will not pick up an FM station 20 miles away but it is a good alarm clock."
"OR";"Love the two sink arrangement for a small sink opening.  The big opening is big enough to wash dishes and the garbage can be dumped into the disposal."
"OR";"Not a direct translation of the French. Many recipes in the French version didn't make it in to the English version. I was really looking forward to the entire book."
"OR";"Both of my dogs love this toy!! I have used it for treats, just for fun, and also for times when they were not eating out of the bowl for whatever reason. Food seems so much better if it's in a toy and more like playing. It will also buy you time for a shower or quick chore when you need a break."
"OR";"Seems to work well.  I bought it for a camera that had been modified for astrophotography work.  It takes care of the color change that modification causes, and does it without having to mess with the white balance settings.  Makes the camera useable for normal (non-astro) photographs."
"OR";"horrible. bought for a rental ended up not even using them. you cant screw them tight enough to stay on the handle will twist off in your hand from the outside."
"OR";"I think it's a very useful product although I still haven't figured out how to get my LOCAL weather without getting the entire southwest Florida weather"
"OR";"I bought this stool three years ago and it is loose and wobbly.  It gets some use, but not over used by any means.  I tighten it weekly now and its just not good.  I would not recommend this stool for that reason.  It fit where I needed it and it looked good, but time to replace it with something el"
"OR";"It's a good sock for the money.  Not as heavy a fabric as others, but it should prevent scratches in the gun safe.  Stiches are holding so far.  It won't fit a rifle with an optic attached, but fits a bolt action or lever action ok."
"OR";"Good Red/Green Dot scope. The dot itself can block out small targets at a distance but is generally good to 100 yards or so. Well worth the money."
"OR";"Hey.  It's a barrel adaptor.  About as sexy as thumb tacks.  Works like a champ, and well finished.  Can't say much more about a barrel adaptor."
"OR";"good for basic and basic action shoots. not for pros but for mid range price and use for basic action like sports, great .... great for beginners or mid users. company sent basic in mail and had no issues."
"OR";"I love Christine Feehan and this book was recommended to me by a friend. It started out slow and gained some traction but lost me half-way through. I did like it, but it was a little slow."
"OR";"The knives don't work well as steak knives.  The serrated blade tears apart whatever you try to cut, rather than slicing.  Throwing them out."
"OR";"We were amazed how fast we got back our results. The vet thought our dog was Schnauzer/Wheaten Terrier, but he wasn't. He is Schnauzer/Poodle!  Now we know what health risks to watch for."
"OR";"Works wonderfully. We have had for several months now and it is still going strong. I love the length of the cord it reaches much further. I love how much it picks up, very helpful since we deal with pet hair. Easy to empty and clean. Affordable and reliable."
"OR";"I rated these a 5 star before I wore them to school. They are LOUD! Squeak squeak squeak all through the halls. Students turn and look, they are very much a disappointment and a waste--I cannot wear these in public without causing people to turn and look."
"OR";"My son got so many compliments on Halloween for his costume! Creeped out even a few adults :)  It was hard to keep the mesh part up to cover the ""neck"", so I used some safety pins to attach the mesh to the plastic neck and that solved that issue!"
"OR";"Planning on reading the next one because I'm still trying to find out what's going to happen with her and the Mountie and if she ends up staying in the tundra"
"OR";"I bought this case a while ago for my Macbook. I loved it. It was durable and protected my Mac. The stand was also a plus on flat surfaces. Unfortunately, with age it broke. Also if you don't clean it often crud will pile up and it's noticeable because this product is see through."
"OR";"We ordered these for two if our boys. They're lightweight yet supportive for growing feet.  Perfect alternative to crocs. The kids are able to slip them on easily and wear them pretty much for anything. My husband likes them so well he ordered himself a pair."
"OR";"I ordered this because I wanted something easier than the usual chicken carrot made from scratch cake that I usually make for the pup's birthday. It's definitely easy. Add the ingredients and stir. My oven was not working so I put it in a silicon bone shaped dish in the microwave for the 2 minutes i"
"OR";"Love the print and color of these rugs but they are very very thin. Great accent pieces but the runner is an unusual size and the small area rug is very small."
"OR";"The North star ""Romance Books"" are excellent light reading with delightful characters and interesting plots. ""Once Burned"" is no exception. Each book details the life of a different North star resident and how he/she finds his/her life partner."
"OR";"I've read a ton of thrusters books...but none with this total woman's perspective...I LOVE IT AND CAN'T WAIT TO BRING READ THE REST!!
"
"OR";"It works really great as it is a replacement for an old Walkman. My wife loves and it sounds amazingly good. the radio is pretty good, too."
"OR";"This was a rip off of Ivy Symone's CRUSH series. Same storyline but with a horrible delivery. I knew I read this book before. Sorry if u are gonna read this storyline get the ORIGINAL one from Ivy Symone cause this is a terrible one!!!!!!!!!!!"
"OR";"Very cute outfit, my niece loves this! Great deal compared to the prices of American girl clothes. The dress is much shorter than I expected."
"OR";"Very nice refurb!  Looks brand new and works great.  Purchased for my wife to get away from small phone screen."
"OR";"This is a really good ladder.  My only criticism on the installation instructions is that they should have a picture that illustrates where the retaining bolts/nails go instead of a written description.  A picture is worth 1000 words (and they only used about 20 to try describe the nail placement)."
"OR";"Great quality bag for good price. Waxed canvas looks and feels really good and brace zipper is very smooth."
"OR";"I have got to say if you can imagine an action movie this would take it over the edge. Makes you say dang at the end and amazed at how crazy this movie is."
"OR";"This puppia really helps to with making an unruly and not easy to walk dog easy to walk. My parents dog will not leave home without it."
"OR";"OK, they're couplers.  They have one function, to join 2 cables that end in male RCA jacks.  They do it.  The fit is snug and the contact is positive.  The color coding is a convenience that's nice to have.  Red for right, eh."
"OR";"I like using this dvd and the belt that came with it is very effective.  The product was a little slow in arriving at my house, but otherwise I was satisfied with this purchase overall."
"OR";"Very powerful belt sander. I got it specifically to work on floors, but have used it also to make furniture. It tracks well and doesn't bog down. The dust collector does a pretty good job, but you might consider attaching a vacuum hose."
"OR";"Nice Back pack lots of storage room in large compartment. wide wheel base makes it easy to pull over obstacles. Would have gave it 5 stars but the outer walls are not lined as in My Targus laptop backpack."
"OR";"Love Belvin is a BEAST with a pen. I fell in love with  Ezra and Lex's story. This is a must read series. Will be waiting for Spring 2016."
"OR";"Seemed to be just fine and then suddenly just quit working after about 6 months. Cleaned the terminals on battery, etc. Nope - it's a goner. Not my unit as I had the old Dyson battery. Charged it up and it runs my unit. Try another brand I guess."
"OR";"This was a lifesaver for my tonsillectomy. I bought two and some additional ice inserts so I would never have to be without. Worked like a charm- highly recommend."
"OR";"these lights are very hard to find,the light i have is very old and this site was the only place i could find a replacement bulb to fit the light.thanks a lot for the service"
"OR";"Who doesn't love Terry Pratchett, and this book is no exception. It's funny, quirky, consistently discworld, and it has lots of tiny magic men running around the place fighting, getting drunk, and generally getting into trouble. What's not to like :-)"
"OR";"My dog loves her new bed. A very nice thickness to be super cozy. This is a great dog bed and a great price point!!"
"OR";"Great scent. It's fruity but no too sweet. One small cube is enough to spread through and entire 2 story 1800 sqft house"
"OR";"I bought all the variations of Keepons and these are still the best. They definitely hold your glasses on because they make the best skin contact. They are a medium size but can stretch over most glasses."
"OR";"The plot is fast paced, the scenery logical, the activities legal and illegal ring true. Overall, this is an extremely good book Kudos  to the author."
"OR";"This product definitely removes a lot of hair but after researching I found that it actually cuts the hair rather than pulling out the undercoat. I noticed that my cat's fur next to the skin has a prickly feel where the hair has been cut. I don't use it any more."
"OR";"Luther Davis wrote and produced this dark, doom-laden 1964 movie.  For me it works on two levels.  In many ways it resembles a Hitchcock suspense movie.  Will the wealthy widow, trapped in a stalled elevator in her home during a long weekend, survive the confinement and the violence and threats she "
"OR";"I bought this knife for the Camino de Santiago.
And I needed it to open beers, cut bread, cut tape, and uncork wine.

And guess what - it did it!
Sharp knife, scissors and saw.

Was light for my pack and got used all the time."
"OR";"My husband loves his jacket he makes a statement everytime he wears it
Great buy lovely bright colours.  Perfect fit."
"OR";"I'd suggest getting a size smaller, as they run pretty big and this ring cannot be resized. But it looks amazing and I have received dozens of compliments on it"
"OR";"I enjoyed this book and the candid point of view of today's churches.  I recommend for anyone searching for answers about today's biggest problems in the local church."
"OR";"Basically porn.  But then I did read the whole book.  Not realistic but an escape for a few hours.  I was really put off by the main character is demeaned on several levels."
"OR";"I did enjoy the book .my friend read it also . it was enlighting .very good plot I read her books all  the time when she has new ones."
"OR";"Do not order more than one box as Amazon does not take back even unopened cat food ...something to remember in case your cat does not like"
"OR";"We have used a few of these over the years, including from Pampered Chef. They always seem to break.  This one has held up nicely for a few months.  Easy to use and to clean up."
"OR";"I am never disappointed when I read  a Karen Kingsbury book!!  She pulls you right in from the beginning and the only problem at the end is that you do not want the story to be completed!"
"OR";"We are taking care of an abandoned cat outdoors and I can tell you that this works perfectly! The water stays cold and there is no freezing - no ice at all. We've had quite a bitter winter this year. A lot of 1 digit and below 0 days and it works just great."
"OR";"Really soft and really big. I wanted it baggy, and I'm so glad I didn't order the XL! The large is enormous! I just wish it was a zip up, but there are buttons all the way up which leave gaps. So, make sure you're wearing clothes underneath!"
"OR";"Soft cotton, fits as expected. Very useful for nighttime diaper changes. A great gift to give a first or second time mom!"
"OR";"An incredible outline for the Gospel of Mark. Dr. Keller does a masterful job of weaving Jesus' ministry and its manifestation with Old Testament reminders. Simple, yet profound."
"OR";"I ordered this not even thinking about the chance of it not fitting on the front fans of my Antec 900 since there's 2 walls protruding on the sides of the front of the case. I got it to fit by cutting at it though. I wouldn't suggest doing it but hey, it works now!"
"OR";"This is such a cute spoon rest.  When stirring my coffee, I was always laying the spoon on the counter.  Now I have this next to my coffeemaker so no more coffee spots on the counter.  I haven't tried using it for anything larger than a regular size table spoon."
"OR";"these ram sticks worked fine in my friends old computer, gave him more room to work with program that needed ram to work propperly."
"OR";"It's been a long time since a book made me cry, and the first time it made me cry both in horror and in joy. It's not an easy read, but like many books that make you work a bit, it's rewarding and I think you will never forget it. Read it if you dare."
"OR";"I gave this 5 stars because I simply loved it! I feel sad that it's over and hope more is written. Maybe the little Lyon could grow up? I don't know. I simply fell in love with the characters and absolutely loved lyons very alpha and protective character."
"OR";"Had me hooked at first chapter. I really like this book and the formatting and editing is just fine. Must have been reformatted and reedited to remove problems. Get this."
"OR";"Keeps a great charge and the vac. does not drop in energy, it goes until it runs out then just shuts it off completely so you aren't leaving fuzz on the floor as it slowly dies...."
"OR";"Nothing special here.  It doesn't apply much rotational force, although it does apply plenty of downward force on the screw. If you have a driver drill, you don't need this."
"OR";"Decent quality of hay. They're quite a lot of the tougher stalks of hay but my guinea pigs like chewing on those. If your pigs don't like the stick like stalks I probably wouldn't buy this particular bag."
"OR";"I was excited to get such a bargain for one of the greatest commentaries on the Bible, however, after realizing I had to go through every book to get to the end, that is a lot of scrolling, too much scrolling. Please fix this and you will have a real blessing for those who study God's Word."
"OR";"Perfect for individual needs of hot water: instant soup, hot cocoa, warming baby's bottles, etc.. It's quick and easy to use."
"OR";"Extremely cute, would give to any child due to it being really soft. The only hard part are the eyes but that's like most stuffed animals."
"OR";"Such a tumultuous time, not just for the country, but for any one at that ended age between child and adult. The mystery of the record and what could be inspire the reader to find hope in any situation."
"OR";"Love this watch!!  Also great price!  I also bought the white with rose gold.  Would buy this style and brand again!"
"OR";"I like this series.  It has a lot of twists and turns in it.  I found that it was hard to put down.  good read for anyone that likes this style of books."
"OR";"Not easy to grow anything in these small tubes.  The plant didn't show roots and ended up rotting out and not really growing.  Would not recommend."
"OR";"Bought these to replace the trebles on all my Rapalas when the box was left in a wet garage. They seem sharp and look decent, well see how they hold up!"
"OR";"Very nice quality shirt and fit right, feel good and warm jacket, enjoy the jacket every time when ride the bike."
"OR";"I love reading historical novels. And this one is really good. The character of Kate Chase is so interesting and this book brings her to life."
"OR";"This book held my interest till the end. Had a great plot. Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to read a good who done it."
"OR";"Never give up on your dreams. Don't let people that disagree with you  bring you down. Great book. It shows you every day people are the same as famous."
"OR";"The fitness ball package comes with everything you need to get going. The ball, the pump, and access to some basic stretches/exercises. The ball is durable and as described. It holds even with sweat which is nice for stretching post hard workouts."
"OR";"use these on a line i ran to a sunken destroyer in my tank.. brought the thing to life.. price was fair and shipping qiuck!! good deal."
"OR";"My dog LOVES this!
Great purchase, great quality toy for curious pups!

I ordered the small one for my 10lb dog. Perfect size, squirrels are cute. The tree stump is plush. All the way around a great buy. I definitely recommend this!"
"OR";"Love this towel to put over workout mat. It stays in place and easily washed and dried.  Very long length and fully keeps my mat dry."
"OR";"Great quality, educational, colorful.  My 2 year old loves it and can't wait to get in the sandbox.  Made in Germany."
"OR";"This cable probably functions properly with certain devices.  Between my Mac Mini and my Mitsubishi Projection TV, it did not, best I can see is because there is a sync issue that one or the other do not support.  The cable itself lacks shielding on the final component leads."
"OR";"Another great book by Cornwell in this absorbing series.  Always interesting characters, locations ans plot twists. Such a prolific writer!"
"OR";"I purchased a complete set from Biolite two weeks ago. It arrived missing a critical pot adapter for small pot and pan use. In addition, while I waited for THE FIRM to fill the backorder for the stove and bundle purchased directly from them, they dropped the price by $30 but did NOT credit or adjust"
"OR";"Amazing bolster! The purple color I chose is absolutely beautiful and it arrived in perfect condition. It's firm, yet is fully supportive when laying/using it and I love the fact that it's made in Utah. Overall, very well constructed and would highly recommend!"
"OR";"I couldn't balance myself on this thing, but the kids have mastered it in short order. They really like them.  Buy pads for your kdis though. They will fall off at some point!"
"OR";"The stool looks good and is sturdy but the cushion is super thin.  Sitting on the stool becomes a bit uncomfortable after a while.  The company should definitely add more cushion to the stool."
"OR";"This book was awesome. We meet two people with terrible pasts. They are having issues moving on. When they meet can they finally let there past go and accept the future before them ?"
"OR";"This is a great Blu Ray, production, lighting & all. If you're a true JT fan, this is a Blu Ray you definitely want to add to your Concert DVD collection!"
"OR";"I don't really care for comedies but this one is special. It's very smart writing.
Not only do I like the comedy but the drama is fantastic too. I not only enjoyed this season but
all the seasons afterward."
"OR";"Ssoooo cute and comfy...second one I purchased for great granddaughter. liked it so much after she outgrew I got another in larger size"
"OR";"This guy thinks he needs a bad chick by his side,but he has nothing but problems with this type of woman, finally he wishes up and gets a good woman"
"OR";"This book was quite interesting to me. I agree that many people, even Christians can't handle laments. Most of us are silenced and reduced to ""faking fine. "" No one really wants to know anything about the negative. But everyone seems to be a counselor and offers advice that's unwanted and unneeded. "
"OR";"This bar is great.  I like the dip bars and the high wide grip pull up.  This would be a 5 star product if it had some sort of latch or strap that secures the hanging dip bar.  Otherwise, it will move around a bit."
"OR";"My favorite feature of LED lights is that the instant you turn them on, they're already at full brightness.  No waiting around.  Plus they use less energy!"
"OR";"Got this as replacement for first gen iPad that was slow. This unit would not connect to my home WiFi. Seemed slower than the old
iPad I sold."
"OR";"The 'tulip' shape makes weird shadows, like a vignette, and you have to keep moving it until that goes away. Sometimes it doesn't go away at all. I would've rather had the round shaped lens hood but couldn't find one."
"OR";"I purchased this based on the reviews about the scenes of the ""vintage Disneyland,"" and it surpassed my expectations! Such a delight to see what the park looked like during Walt Disney's time!"
"OR";"I have read all of Christine Feehan's Dark Series. And Solang and Dominic's  Story is one of the best even though all her stories are. Wonderful."
"OR";"Heavy duty cover with two reinforced holes for tie down or bungee. This is my second cover, 1st one of these lasted well over two years in direct Texas sun, wind and inclement weather. You won't be disappointed."
"OR";"Purchased this to scoop directly from the coffee bag (I think that's what it's called). Problem is that it pushes back in very easily. The extender is pretty much useless."
"OR";"it works just like a regular size ironing board, but much handier to use and easier to store,and the flatter the surface its on the better it irons."
"OR";"Didnt last long as advertised. I usually get another brand and my puppy never gets flees. Decided to try this one due to the tick prevention. With this one on the 2nd week she got flees. Not worth the money."
"OR";"My first mystery romance type story. I liked it a lot. It has opened up a whole new genre for me. It got a little long and boring in about 3 parts. But since I love Robyn Carr books, I stuck with it and was rewarded by the following pages."
"OR";"I make sure I pack and take this device everywhere I go.  I haven't really figured out how long the charge lasts, but for now very pleased

Ossie"
"OR";"Just size up and you will be good. My husband loves these. Warm and comfortable. Looks foreword to putting them on every night. The more you wear them the better they get"
"OR";"It was like a diary of events in her political career.  I had already heard a lot about Mrs. Thatcher.  It was just a chronicle of events with all the things that she had to experience as a woman in a leadership roll."
"OR";"Love the characters. Piecing together a torn relationship and a shattered soul, and bringing bad guys to justice. Couldn't put the book down."
"OR";"I received this book free from Amazon for Kindle.  I enjoyed the read and want to thank the publisher for making the work available free of charge."
"OR";"These cut very fast. Used with battery powered drill-driver to cut through studs. Just don't hit a nail! It is not designed to cut through nails. Other than that, great drills."
"OR";"I remember waiting at the theatre for this to open way back when. Very real scenes and probably the best war film made, next to Black Hawk Down!"
"OR";"My dog loves these except that jerk learned how to take the treat out of the rubber toy almost as soon as I give it to her. Does smell slightly vanilla"
"OR";"LOVED this story, but it is a short story that will appear in another book later. So it is not unique. I got the book from CL's website, so it was free."
"OR";"I purchased the case recently to setup a DDR2 gaming PC and it setup very well with a sharp look.

I will attach pictures if I can so anyone interested can see. By the way, the case is big enough to fit a decently large Heatsink in... Which is just awesome."
"OR";"Seems to be helping my 15 yr old Pom's kidney values manageable.  My homeopathic vet likes better than Denamarin or Sam E."
"OR";"I'm a size 13. Usually size 13 fits comfortably and not tight. I need to order a size 14,these shoes were too tight/small. Shoe quality was excellent and the nike swoosh was very bright and vivid. Order a size up just to be sure."
"OR";"As of a couple days ago I fully expected to read one more book, Z is for whatever Sue decided was relevant for the last book in the series, unfortunately she passed away before she got the chance and as her daughter stated, Y is now then end of the alphabet. I'm almost 48 years old and I've been rea"
"OR";"These are awesome! I did a safari-themed scavenger hunt for my daughter's 2nd birthday using these. Basically just spread them out all over the lawn and had the kids find them and put them in their buckets, then the buckets and animals were their party favors. They all loved it! I really like this b"
"OR";"I read the trilogy for second time and loved it even more.  Highly recommend to anyone. The writing style is gentle, detailed and captivating.  Classic."
"OR";"Great quality and the sound did not seem any different then when using a more expensive audio extension cable. I would recommend this product to anyone."
"OR";"I'm happy with the product size, weight and accessories but be mindful, the output flow is only 400 milliliter per minute which is a little under 16 ounces."
"OR";"Super cute luggage for a weekend or overnight! Was not expecting this to be as nice but as described and delivered as promised! Purchased for a teen for those weekend trips! the smaller bag is larger than I expected and very roomy! Well worth the price! Very pleased! would buy again!!"
"OR";"Great read! Many parts and phrases stick with you well after reading them! Would highly recommend this to anyone...especially if you enjoy memoirs."
"OR";"this is the perfect picture book treasury.  all four of my grandchildren loved it when I brought it to read to them.  So glad you carry it because I got it for a new Grammy."
"OR";"Well, not ""I' exactly.  I bought these for my son who has a hobby where he needs flint.  These flints are a little pricey but my son says they are the best.  All I know is you best be careful when handling them.  They may look like a rock but they are very sharp.  My son is extremely pleased with th"
"OR";"We found a cut place on one of the dvd watching it . It totally stop working. A one star rating they don't deserve even that."
"OR";"I WANT PART 2 ASAP. KHYREE  CAYDEN  MEATS CARMEN D'WEL AND MO. MO MOMS IS  SO EVIL IN THIS BOOK. I WONDER WHO WAS SHOOTING AT THEM"
"OR";"I bought the two pack. After wearing one of them for less than four days, the compass was/is in correct. Doesn't even read the same as the other which has not been worn."
"OR";"My husband bought this thingy to attach to our amazon basics cat tree (on his account) - and the cats F'n love it. That and cat nip is what I used to train my new Maine Coon kitty to scratch the cat tree and not the couches."
"OR";"Unfortunately, my 5 cats only found them fun for about 5 minutes.  I now put them in a bag with some Kong catnip and bring new ones out about once a week for something different.  They have lasted a good while, but they don't play with them much once the catnip smell is gone."
"OR";"Good socks for the price. The guards stay in place, and they lasted one entire soccer season. Bought three pairs and no complaints."
"OR";"Essential to any tool box for all the unexpected home repairs that come up- grip, lock, then loosen or tighten whatever needs adjusting without straining your hands"
"OR";"This is another product where the marketing tells a story that is better than the product itself.  This product isn't the highest quality and our kids really don't use it.  Don't get me wrong.  It's ok for some water play outside but the hand pump is pretty flimsy."
"OR";"My 3 year old daughter just received this puppy as a Christmas gift and she adores it!  It goes everywhere with her, and despite what other reviewers might say, it's actually quite easy to cuddle with.  We all love this dog, and I would recommend it to anyone.  It's a great toy!"
"OR";"You needn't be an historian, geologist or even American to be captivated by this insightful and entertaining examination of those movers and shakers of American history (well-known and unknown) who helped to guide it...and the world...through extraordinary accomplishments."
"OR";"My dog's favorite toy.  (He's a Maltese, 8 pounds)  He will retrieve it,or play tug of war with it, and comes running when he hears the squeaker."
"OR";"great price for the Gigs!  These little guys work great and hold all you photos, music, etc... to share w/ your friends."
"OR";"Worked great for several ceiling fans that require multiple expensive pin base style bulbs in one of our rental units."
"OR";"Turns out to be a long yarn and perhaps a bit too fictitious for my tastes, but then when you write a novel you have to have extra ordinary stuff or the plot begins to fade from interest."
"OR";"Nice accent bulb, amber glow. don't think that this bulb can be used as a reading lamp light bulb, it is for mood, aestetic and ambiance only."
"OR";"Bubba does it again, always finding the right in whatever wrong is going on. No spoilers, but he's big, he's bad, and his posse gives ground to no one, especially not family. If you like your humor dark, you've come to the right place."
"OR";"I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these "
"OR";"Very inexpensive solution.  Highly recommended for spare or for hobby use.  It does what you would expect it to do.  The compression is also excellent.  When properly tightened it gets nice and stiff just like the much more costly solutions.  I highly recommend this for a backup or for a primary ."
"OR";"Absolutely mind bogglingly superb!! What a collection of alien life forms!! Foster is insane, and I hope he stays that day for a long, long, long, long time, and continues to share that magnificent insanity with us!"
"OR";"Edge of the seat drama, and some heavy action adventure components.  Tom Hanks and this cast is amazing throughout the movie. This being based on the true events, only helps."
"OR";"These fit on  conduit perfectly! I was building a duck blind on my boat out of conduit and needed something to prevent the ends of the upright posts from damaging the floor of my boat."
"OR";"This is such a nice bed for my senior cat who weighs about 17 pounds. She absolutely took to it the minute I put it down for her. She was sleeping on a crate pad which was put back in the crate. She won't even leave this to go sleep in her favorite chair!"
"OR";"I have read all the Nightwalker books and can't wait for the next. If you like to read a book the transfers you to another world, then this is the book for you...."
"OR";"Used this is Italy for day trips while on tour. It's actually larger than we thought. It held a sweater, guides, snacks and two drinks with room to spare."
"OR";"Got these at a great price. Cant beat it since they're something you throw away. I don't believe they are very hold much liquid. But i put down two. My sheltie has a difficult time aiming on one. Love the larger size bc of that."
"OR";"nice fit an warmth from just one pair. put two pair on together an you could almost walk on ice an have warm feet"
"OR";"I bought 4 bibs...I had an issue with one of them, the zipper failed...I contacted the seller, they responded immediately!! and offered to replace the item asap! no hassle. I am extremely pleased with them and the warmth of these bibs...very comfortable too! I will consider purchasing a few more as "
"OR";"Again, haven't read it yet but it came in a timely manner and I love Susan Mallery's books.  Do I have to add another word?  This is kind of stupid."
"OR";"after adding the batteries, this is a fun and old fashioned toy.  However the strap broke.  Stitched it together for a quick fix.  Very cute and reminds me of my own childhood."
"OR";"This is the final book in the Vatta's War Series.

Overall this is solid sci-fi action. Nothing exceptional, just fine. It would probably be hard to follow if I hadn't read the previous books, but all the characters are growing nicely into their roles, and the plot rolls along to a satisfying conclu"
"OR";"I'm looking forward to future novels about the young detective. This wasn't so bad. I thought it was too technical especially when it refer to history about sports greats. I would like more mystery in his future novels and less history. But the ending was great."
"OR";"Still a great idea for sensory children.  Just wish the pegs stuck in the other pegs a little more. They topple over easily.  They fit in the board just fine."
"OR";"I have been through FOUR bike lights and this is by far the best one, way way better than the others. I got this for my girlfriends scooter and it fits very nicely, it has on a standard type bicycle bars. The other lights even claimed to have 'more' power and were not even near as bright as this. Th"
"OR";"This is genuine adult fantasy at its finest. I don't mean it is pornographic, though there are sexual elements presented within reason. What I mean is that Bakker does not try to beat around the bush here. His characters are flawed, in fact here perfection is defined as the ability to manipulate oth"
"OR";"Good saddle for a sporty fixie that I use for longer commutes.  Not sure it would be all that comfy after 20 miles, but just fine in the 15 mile range!"
"OR";"Fits a large area. Stays in place and I don't have to put holes in my cabinets! It is so nice looing, we just leave it up and keep gate open."
"OR";"Home Movies got better and better, and was cut to short at four seasons. All four sets have tons of extra material on every disc. If you're a fan, you will be more than pleased. I wish they would have removed the beeps over explicit words."
"OR";"This. is very easy to assemble , and the space can be adjusted. Just enough for 3 boots. Hoping you have  boots organizer that can accommodate  more pairs. Make the shoes stays in shape."
"OR";"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunate"
"OR";"Hey it's a lot chunkier than the description and photos alluded to, so depending on your usage will dictate whether that's a good or bad thing.  For me it was a good thing."
"OR";"This is a pack of fun parking violation tickets that are great for a gag or white elephant gift. Sometimes you just need to remind someone that they did a crappy job parking, and these will get your point across and probably put a smile on their face."
"OR";"Good price when you need real dish towels that will get dirty... wash once or twice before use and they will work much better."
"OR";"Great for flipping burgers and the like, just not so much for eggs!!

Didn't realize these were a hard nylon.....thought they were pliable to say the least, BUT, nice overall!!"
"OR";"I read this book in two days and could hardly put it down. Good for a ssymmer read. I live all Nora Roberts books."
"OR";"My 90-year-old friend is able to read the Bible again thanks to the NIV large print we bought.  She is so pleased and so am I.  It's a good tool as eyes change."
"OR";"100 percent satisfied. The quality is great. I have it as a gift and plan to order more. It even came with 2 extra chains that were different lengths."
"OR";"Battery worked fine but screwdriver not included.  Used battery to replace Forerunner 305 wrist GS battery with little modification involved."
"OR";"I got this because the office I work in is notoriously cold, and I thought it would help to keep my feet warm as cold feet was my biggest complaint while at work and that, in turn, made the rest of me cold.

Anyway, we have carpet in my office and this thing really slides badly on carpet.  It doesn'"
"OR";"So cute and perfect for the kitties. NO whisker fatigue. Holds 3/4 cup of dry food which is a pleasant surprise. Also everyone whining about the sticker being hard to get off.... I slapped some goo gone and those stickers were gooooGONE in a jiffy."
"OR";"This looks great! Haven't used it yet....can't find anyone willing to let me try it on them.  But it sure is loud when you press the volt button."
"OR";"Great scarf. I use this scarf when working with hay in the barn. Hay dust is a real problem but this scarf makes it easy to deal with."
"OR";"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do.  This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine"
"OR";"This is the best option i've found for wiring a speaker-level output from a receiver to an RCA style input on an amp. The female to female connectors will come in handy too."
"OR";"Dogs ate a couple times and then starting turning nose up to it. Smells bad. I have to use peanut butter to get them to eat it. Will not buy it again."
"OR";"Although it introduces interesting ideas about the interpretation of the Creation account in Genesis, it fails to come to any conclusions and its assumptions are somewhat weak. A thorough argument and comparison to scientific evidence would have made the point stronger."
"OR";"The collar did come as ordered.  The gold stitching is actually mustard yellow; I probably should have inquired more about that as I truly wanted gold stitching.  Other than that, the blue collar is great and the name and phone number, very vivid easy to read for sure!"
"OR";"IT WAS FUN TO READ THE CURRENT INFORMATION ON HOW THE ROYAL FAMILY SPENDS CHRISTMAS.  I READ IT TWICE.  IT DOES NOT HAVE MANY PAGES BUT THOSE PAGES ARE LOADED WITH INFORMATION. VERY ENJOYABLE."
"OR";"This bottle was a great buy, dishwasher safe and is very easy to clean. The wide opening make the water bottle easy to fill and drink from."
"OR";"works perfectly with my gtx960 and my 4ktv@60hz, very well constructed, braided cable looks very durable and does what it supposed to. gaming and youtube @ 4k is great"
"OR";"Love the color, perfect for the summer but as always the round toe shoe is a little tight by the toes as always and will have to be worn a few times to break in."
"OR";"what can you say, good food, well balanced and the dogs loved it arrived well packed undamaged and in a very timely amount of time"
"OR";"Well worth the money I have rheumatory arthritis so a regular caulking gun hurts my hands after a while but with this Milwaukee caulking gun so much easier and clean"
"OR";"I enjoyed both of these books.  I loved the characters and the stories.  I recommend them to all.  K B writes books that almost seam real."
"OR";"A time long gone, sadly. Inspiring tale of gentle discovery. Beautiful prose, honest conversation. Charley must have been a wonderful dog, too. His conversation is probably the most real of them all. I've had a standard poodle, and they do communicate very well....."
"OR";"Med fira my 10 pound dog in every brand but this one. In this one its small and forces her legs to the front, will never buy again."
"OR";"SOOO cute! soooo expensive, but fits my 38D boobs comfortably and will cover my c-section tummy bulge in a cute, fashionable way (NOT frumpy!)"
"OR";"I love High Sierra backpacks, they are sturdy and last a whole school year. My son can't wait to start using it."
"OR";"Received the item before the shipping due date.  It is exactly what I wanted except for the tassel,  I wished it could have been taken out so I could place a real tassel in the frame.  Otherwise, great item for its price.  Look good hanging on the wall."
"OR";"I love these Buster Keaton movies. They are some of his best work. The video quality is great on this set too. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase."
"OR";"This table is gorgeous! Easy to put together and perfect if you have young kids as the edges are rounded! Its easy to clean and easy to get under with a vacuum!"
"OR";"I am loving this author and this series.  I really feel the Lord is impressing him to write these books.  I really like him and I really like his series."
"OR";"I got it for emergencies and camping.  I'm very satisfied as it appears to have a decent weight and should be quite versatile.  I was sent the red which is more of a brick color.  No complaints on this one."
"OR";"This was a good story.  It had good characters and a good storyline.  I thought it was very enjoyable.  I think everyone would enjoy reading this lighthearted Christmas romance
I received this book for free from ebook discovery.  I voluntarily review this book.  This is my honest review."
"OR";"Added this to my trek Superfly 9.8SL when I  upgraded it from the 160 front brakes to the 180. Very easy to install,  took less than 10 minutes including the disc."
"OR";"Went on great.  Tried to limit the amount so that we did not get the cloud effect that we read in the instructions.  However, after a few rain showers we had to scrub the tiles as they had a white film all over.  Could be user error but I doubt it as we followed directions very closely."
"OR";"Tells the story of the Medjugorje apparitions just as I have read about them. Fascinating  relatively recent apparition of the Virgin Mary and its impact on those who see her and those who believe she appears, but cannot see her."
"OR";"This is finally the best waste option in south Texas I found. It is amazing stuff and comes in handy when I do not have sanitation. Great for camping, boating, and emergencies."
"OR";"This is truly, you get what you pay for, as I paid ~$5 + shipping.

This romper is completely see-thru, and there was an area on the collar / neckline where the seam wasn't sewn at all leaving a hole."
"OR";"Driver disk has no drivers.
Win111 disk installs but fails to find the network usb stick on any USB port in the system.
And I wasted overnight mailing from Amazon."
"OR";"soft but color was off and a strip of purple 13 of the way into scarf would make it hard to wear anyway other than around neck....will not buy again"
"OR";"Not presented in any interesting way. I unfortunately did not finish it yet. Definitely presented some interesting facts about our food and how corn is used in nearly everything we eat."
"OR";"Attractive, slim, functional, non-intimidating folder. Nil adjustments required on receipt, required sharpening. Sharpened quickly, easily to razor edge. Deploys very smoothly and quickly. Very nice gentleman's EDC"
"OR";"..i thought it would be just kinda silly tongue n cheek humor like what we do in the shadows but it was clever with an interesting twist.. and hes quite likeable for a killer.."
"OR";"Holy Moses, what's not to like about this lens? OK, sure... it's 1.8 and not 1.4, but seriously! For the price what do you expect? This lens should be in EVERY starter bag."
"OR";"This was actually a birthday present from me to me!!!!  Just got it this week and I absolutley love it!!!!!  The color is gorgeous!  The leather is sooooo soft!  And I am obsessed with Fossil watches and jewelry.  Had no idea they made wallets.  Saw it on line and ordered it immediately.  Happy Birt"
"OR";"Crystal clear sound even after spending a Chicago winter outside. Excellent sound and good bass. These are perfect for a medium to large deck."
"OR";"It showed how people saw Hitler's Germany at that time.  I thought it should have more history and less novel.  It could happen in our country, if we don't wake up to what is happening here!"
"OR";"a good story. a little too rushed, same elements, same good plot, but not enough transitioning as in earlier books.  ending made me go ???"
"OR";"Fun book, pretty much what you would expect from NR.  Didn't disappoint but no surprises.  A good summer dose of brain bubblegum."
"OR";"Everything described about the item was exact,work great ,Great price,this thing is awesome , planing too buy another one soon,"
"OR";"I would not buy any other brand after studying the ingredients in this.  My dog loves it, dry, and since he will eat dry food so heartily, I think he deserves this."
"OR";"Absolutely love the quality, color and price. The cat seems to have taken to it so I bought a matching cat bed from Amazon for the kitty."
"OR";"It's flexible more than I expected. It feels too soft but so far so good. I purchased oil rub bronze but it looks like almost black color."
"OR";"They came in tact.  The latches are fine.  The latches are the slide-y kind.  Yeah, they aren't the BEST, but for storage of crap, they work fine.  I wouldn't store Grandma's heirloom china in them, but for my stock-piling of bathroom stuff, they work fine."
"OR";"I love this cup!  It's well made and the color is excellent.  Perfect for my coffee in the morning surrounded by all my little owls in the sun room! :)"
"OR";"Very interesting movie. The play back quality was no to good. I never complained to Amazon about this. They contacted me via e-mail and refunded my rental amount. That's why Amazon is #1 in customer service! Great job! That's why I'm PRIME!!!!!"
"OR";"I have many different workouts but this DVD is my all-time favorite.  I really see the results and I love that it has customizable workouts.  I  had this disc for about two years and I lost it a few months ago but I love it so much that I had to re-order it because I couldn't get along without it."
"OR";"Runs small. I'm normally a medium and I had to buy XL to fit perfect. Comfortable shirt and does the job. Love the color too."
"OR";"Very comfortable bra! Super soft fabric feels like I'm not wearing a bra at all...great support..no digging underwire, no slipping straps.
There's nothing worse than an ill fitting bra and i am extremely happy with these."
"OR";"We had high expectations considering the good reviews, but unfortunately very boring, limited plot, poor acting. Had to turn it off. Silly, just didn't make sense."
"OR";"Perfect for my Kids play room!! Easy to put together and sturdy!! Came early!! Lays down onto bed very easy for guests!!"
"OR";"The only puppy food we will buy from here on out! Our Australian shepherd puppy has a  beautiful coat! She loves her food, and it seems to digest extremely well. No issues at all!"
"OR";"I've had this model for several years and was delighted to find a replacement(s) on Amazon.  They are BIG and 2 of them are perfect for our 4 indoor cats.  I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green pl"
"OR";"I've always loved the way Frances Mayes strings beautiful words into meaningful sentences into interesting paragraphs. I was also amazed that she remembers so many details and sometimes painful events of her youth. If you are from the South, you will love this book!"
"OR";"So cute, my daughter has so much fun playing with these, plastic is alittle cheap feeling but being able to chop up to pretend cook is a learning experience for my princess"
"OR";"This bit set has great pieces/sizes you use a lot and have come in handy for many projects.  They do hold up under usage.  I would buy again."
"OR";"Adorable and realistic tools. My son loves this toy. He enjoys being able to grab his tool box and work along side with grandpa."
"OR";"The statue is nice but had a flaw in it. Probable they don't check them when China sends them to the US because we take anything from China. Like Mattel and the poison toys."
"OR";"Comfortable pads that fit on the outside of the ears. (not on top so it doesn't crush the ears) The mic is clear and crisp. The sound is premium. Lots of play room so it's not squeezing my head as I have ran into in the past with other headsets. GREAT product and not too expensive."
"OR";"Unfortunately, the version sent to me was apparently a European DVD, so I could not view it (I was reimbursed quickly). I have viewed this performance in the past, and I loved it! What a trip to see the Imperial Palace as a setting for the last of Puccini's amazing operatic scores!"
"OR";"Does what it says on the tin. Mine was 50'x1"", not 1""x50' as expected. Through the transformative power of geometry across the line y=x I was able to re-orient it to fit my desired application.

Don't forget to get some buckles of joiner plates to attach them with."
"OR";"It did fit my old 742 but it said right on the box ""Not for 742"" so I returned the item. You can find this product at any sporting goods store."
"OR";"I was pretty shocked at how expensive these seats are but I'm very happy with them. My son is comfortable, they're very sturdy, it doesn't get hot in the sun and I especially like the plastic coating on the chains. This swing will last forever. It's definitely worth the money!"
"OR";"Our girlies ( two toy poodles) love these cookies!  They are bite size, grain free, low in calories and excellent flavor choices. We watch their weight, these are our treats of choice. Great price for 3 pack, fast shipping."
"OR";"No issue with the merchant - ClothingShopOnline shipped the item promptly and it was clearly brand-new - but I buy these extra-huge sizes to allow for the inevitable shrinkage in the wash.  I'm not a massive guy, just taller than most...and my goal is to start out with something closer to the size o"
"OR";"It is a fake arduino, it works but is not genuine..

Also, the reset button don't works, I had to use the one in a modular board I connected on top of if"
"OR";"the screen is super amazing
i used it on a surface pro 4 and the screen split makes more productive and the quality of colors is even more than the surface screen itself"
"OR";"Balsa and Chagum continue to live in the mill. Saya is spotted by a wealthy family, and betrothed to the heir against her will. She falls into a deep coma from her grief. Tanga uses a magic spell to bring her back. After that, Chagum challenges a strong boy to a fight to preserve his family's honor,"
"OR";"Works as advertised.  Unfortunately I purchased an iPod Touch pretty soon after which obviously relegated the Zen to the junk pile.

Poor little fella."
"OR";"Very entertaining musical drama about a black Aboriginal singing group from Australia who sing soul songs of the sixties to soldiers in Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam war. Filmed in Australia and Vietnam."
"OR";"We gave this to our 4 year old grand son who is all about the building trades right now!  He loves it. He also has the
Firefighter Set which has been a favorite of his."
"OR";"I got this for my gf for her bday she loved it. works great. I use real candles in it and never had any issues. Looks great."
"OR";"The heroine is a snarky, curvy-figured insurance investigator who has had it with less than honest men. The hero is a  smoking, hot shape shifter who is a typical alpha. You get the picture."
"OR";"I don't love it.

The writing is a bit convoluted at times and somehow, (maybe this should be good), it seems more like fiction than a real story. When I pick it up, I enjoy it but I don't feel compelled to pick it up.

I do believe the author did an incredible amount of work to write it ..."
"OR";"Made my dog sick. Vomited after the 2 times he had them the expiration date was not legible , only half printed. I threw them away before realizing I should've returned them."
"OR";"This is a great filter. I had one of these in a previous tank, which is why I ordered this one. It is quiet and easy to clean. It is also very easy to assemble. I recommend It."
"OR";"On the one hand, this one is a ""designer"" teddy bear, complete with Swarovski eyes, nose, silver heart and silver banner; on the other hand, it's the softest bear you'd ever lay your hands on if the recipient allowed it.  I was curious about the hour-long video about the history of the Care Bears as"
"OR";"I was extremely disappointed in this product. I purchased it for my rabbit. I was expecting it to be the size of a small coke can. It's the size of a large pencil. Definitely not worth the money. I hope Kaytee is able to recommend this to mice and hamsters as it's even too small for a guinea pig."
"OR";"As usual, Latrivia did an awesome job portraying people and events. The book was we written, full of action and juicy love scenes. As always the book was well worth my time and money! Kudos Latrivia! Anxiously awaiting your next book!"
"OR";"While this is the best romance ever, it pales in comparison to the 6 Outlander books that follow. It's clear that Diana Gabaldon does her research, as the other books are rich in historical detail. much more so that this, the first of the series that was basically her ""practice"" to see if should wri"
"OR";"Adhesive isn't great (using in a vehicle where the temperature varies significantly).

The opening is also too wide for a single charging cable (iphone) and will not hold it in place.

Probably works fine for indoor use on larger diameter cables."
"OR";"Love how this projector shines the time and outside temperature alternately. Very handy while making a trip to the bathroom in the night! We aim ours at the wall by the door to the bathroom."
"OR";"Installation was easy. The faucet looks great. The only issue I have is that even on stream, these is still a small amount of spray around the main stream. For instance, when I pull it out and fill my coffee maker, there is spray around the fill hole..."
"OR";"I do agree with a lot of the fans in that I felt the he liked the killers & did not want them punished. They should have gotten life without parole Not the sentence he got. And he should have been charged with both deaths."
"OR";"Headphones work well, volume is good and they shut out loud noises. However, the range, particularly on the AM frequency is spotty. Makes me wish it had a more powerful antenna. If you live in a populated place with good reception it probably won't be a problem."
"OR";"Were having many problems with my 8 year old laptop with only 2GB of ram while using Adobe Lightroom.  I was seriously planning to replace computer.  With only this small and cheap upgrade it is a 100% improvement.  I can now wait a little longer to replace computer."
"OR";"i have been using this DVD for over 5 years.  i reach for it when i don't want to jump around.  the movements are slow and steady, deceptive. it takes time, proper breathing, and strong core to achieve the effortless grace.  i still haven't mastered the ab work out (the last part).

**About the work"
"OR";"An interesting idea, very clearly explained. Easy to follow, the author covers everything you need to know, exactly how to do it. Very cheap to give it a try too, as you can do it using free photos if you want. So you really have nothing to lose as it is  low or no cost to start up."
"OR";"Sarah is so real, and there is much in her life that relates closely to my experiences.  But I really like how she thinks.  I am very curious how her relationships with her husband, with Max, and with Carter will evolve.  Even after reading the first two books, I have been surprised by each ending.."
"OR";"This stuff is  the worst quality I ever had. I am a sider (construction worker), and it last about two hours , before it get holes..
 Similar gloves I get from Chinese store (for half price) last for 1 day.
Don't waste your money!!!!"
"OR";"very sharp right out of the box. i have been using leather conditioner to soften the sheath. the sheath is make of thick leather and needs to be broke in before I wear it into the field."
"OR";"I didn't want it to end.  Really loved it.  I highly recommend it.  I can't wait to read the next. Book after this one."
"OR";"Julienne's zucchini into nice ribbons for ""zoodles"", but frequently the peels get stuck, requiring frequent 'de-gunking'. But works and didn't cost $30!"
"OR";"These are actually GIANT muffin cups, unlike many that are labeled as extra large or giant but are standard size, if that.  These will make giant Texas muffins and cupcakes."
"OR";"Our first hook broke because my son used it to open something with.  This replacement hook worked perfectly for the rainbow loom. Did not come with the cover."
"OR";"I tried several harnesses before settling on this one.  It is hard to find a harness- type collar that fits and is comfy for a tiny dogs, but a harness is very necessary to protect little necks.  This size small fits my 5-1/2-pound, 5-month-old pom."
"OR";"I am reading the books in order and this is the only one so far that I have not really loved.  Not near as good as the others.  Slow, slow beginning and just not very interesting."
"OR";"So far, we love this placemat.  Easy to wipe off (even sticky stuff like syrup) and it is laminated on both sides, so no images scratching and rubbing off, as we have found with cheaper placemats.  My daughter is obsessed with firetrucks and enjoys looking at all of the detail in the images."
"OR";"This is a perfect beach bag. It is compact yet holds even our very large construction trucks. Sand falls out of it easily, reducing mess in our car."
"OR";"If you love the women's murder club, you will easily love this one! Patterson has done it again. Multiple plots, multiple twists, much fun."
"OR";"Sweet story packed into a short book.  Sometimes I felt like I missed something because it is pretty short.  A wonderful love."
"OR";"It wasn't that expensive but is kind of small and uncomfortable to hold.  The cord on the handle came undone after a couple of uses and then frayed.  It was sharp though."
"OR";"I chose this ratings because it was a catch up and final season after the Writer's Strike.  Mrs Keaton couldn't stop Alex from leaving home after graduation.  It wouldn't work."
"OR";"I won't add anything about the movie itself, but will comment on the commentary by Anthony R Santoro.  I have been reading about Prussia and Germany for many years and just finished ""The Iron Kingdom"" by Christopher Clark.  It is an excellent book about the history of Prussia from 1600 to 1947.  Aft"
"OR";"My wife asked me to order this for her and she loves it. I played the DVD through our home theater system and she enjoyed the music and the workout. I guess I will have to try it next."
"OR";"These fit smaller than I was expecting. They are similar to a Gap tank top I have that I love, but tighter so they look a bit scandalous. Good for sleeping."
"OR";"Best fence  ever I had, excellent quality, heavy duty, reliable,easy-to-use made forever
Extremely easy to set-up. . Excellent packaging and protection
I would definitely recommend to a friend without hesitation, especially for this low price!"
"OR";"I use this to carry everything from drill bits to tiny washers in a tool bag and it holds them all tightly inside within their respective compartments.  Recommmend."
"OR";"Each book of the sequels just keeps getting better and better!! This one particularly had my heart racing though but of course not in a bad way."
"OR";"Best bag ever, ive compared quite a few and this one is hands down best quality, very heavy, very sturdy, very well made"
"OR";"It was ok..h  was kind of a leech. I mean her older half sister (book 1) is one of the biggest country singer helped her get recognized. They share same father who had a double life. I didn't like either the H/ h."
"OR";"The most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever owned! Ugly as sin in my opinion but they are a summer must have when you need something other than a flip flop to put on"
"OR";"Bigger than I thought it would be. Held up through two airline flights, two trips in boats, and being lugged up and down an island. No tears, rips or issues so far."
"OR";"Perfect fit, great price.  Revived the helmet to functional use.  Beats buying a new helmet when the helmet is in excellent condition."
"OR";"Light weight, well made, the aluminum CO2 cover is not necessary for the operation of tool, but it does give some protection from the freezing effect when using."
"OR";"I can't say enough about this dress!  It is very simple but perfect in all the ways. I am 5'3 and 140 with a 40D bust and normally wear a L but went with the XL because I saw mixed reviews on how it fit. A L would have fit  fine but the XL works too as this is meant to be loose and drape. This fits "
"OR";"Burns well in my alcohol stove.  It would not light in the extreme cold though...I was told to use a candle to warm up my alcohol stove first."
"OR";"This is one of the best toys ever, and we got it for a great price here.  The junior size is wonderful for kids and both kids use them with ease and joy.  I just wish you could change the batteries -- if you get more than one pair, you won't be sorry -- they're a hit!"
"OR";"I combined this with my alphabet magnets and it is great! I love the different animals you get. Not only does it promote first words, first letter for a-z, but also I use it for animal sounds. My 13 month old and I love it!!! I would totally recommend it to other parents!"
"OR";"For the price, this is it man. The cards do sometimes fall out when i open it, so keep it facing up when you open it. I thought 8 cards would be enough, but I quickly found that i needed a bigger case...so if you have a small gig where water may come into play, get it."
"OR";"The book was a huge disappointment after her ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" It was, I'm sure, hard to top the first one published and so enjoyed by so many."
"OR";"First Stone novel. Good read. And it was not even a Parker novel. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Been a long time since I read a novel."
"OR";"This book is a great read. I'd give it an A+. It's hard to imagine that one person could have experienced as many encounters as Capstick did."
"OR";"I really like this call.  The hen calls are a good low tone, and the gobble call (watch a video) gets reply calls from turkeys almost every time.  For an inexpensive box call, I couldn't be happier."
"OR";"Perfect size for my dog kennel. The dogs have thrown it around, and it is still in one piece! They love the soft bed to sleep on !"
"OR";"It's basic 16 gauge speaker wire. Not super flexible, but not hard to work with, has a durable feel, and strips cleanly even with cheap stripers."
"OR";"The story was ok at best you really should edit! The words in this book that were misspelled and words that shouldn't been in the sentence. Autocorrect while reading through this book is not what the reader wants to do. The book was boring the female lead character I really wanted to shoot her after"
"OR";"I bought this faucet to use with our filter in the kitchen along with a Kraus kitchen faucet. It looks great and does the job nicely. Packaging was good."
"OR";"Inexpensive,and works great. Very securely packed to prevent shipping damage.
The instructions and data were spot on, including voltages at startup and at idle. It has multiple stage charging, going to an idle state when the battery is fully charged."
"OR";"What to say I just finished ""tuesdays with morrie""  and  can't stop weeping a wonderful book , about death but so life affirming can't imagine anyone reading it and not  come away with a desire to live everyday to the fullest. Morrie and Mitch will be with me forever"
"OR";"Works perfectly with my iMac.  I have the wireless mouse, external hd plugged in all the time and use the other two ports as input from other things such as my MP3 player and it works for everything.  My old hub was powered but had begun to short out but this works just as I had hoped."
"OR";"Though I've come to expect learning new things about the subject animal in one of Emma Child's books, I was amazed at just how much I didn't know about rabbits. Quite a bit of new ideas for this old soul.

Excellent book."
"OR";"Took a while to get used to the mouthpiece, but I now really like not having to open a lid to get to the water, and don't need to worry about a nozzle flipping open.  I was also worried that the design might be hard to clean, but I'm not having any problems keeping it clean."
"OR";"fits perfect to the phone. small and styling. love the way it makes the phone look. perfect gift for any holiday or birthday."
"OR";"I love the smell, I brush and clean my dog with this product and is really good to keep its hair clean, with good smell and healthy"
"OR";"Be Careful - this will not work with your Toyota if you have the Navigation system.  The Navigation disc in most Toyota cars use the port on the back to connect the DVD player (data) to your radio.  Therefore, there is no place to plug this in....  Recommend calling them first before ordering."
"OR";"It was nice to read something with action from a woman's point of view.  A great deal of humor as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
"OR";"I know chucks run big... should have ordered a half size smaller but still fit pretty well and really like them"
"OR";"I haven't had the need to switch back and forth between my Tivo and Roku yet so I don't know how that will go but the unit seems to work well."
"OR";"A month after I purchased this I gave it 4 stars.  Today I will give it only one.

The pan is great, a bit tinny so it warps easily but pretty good.  The problem: The rack in NOT Stainles and ""rots.""  See photo.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an i"
"OR";"Great investment to keep the quadcopter fun going. Highly recommend when purchasing the Hubsan X4 H107C and H104L. Each flying session on fresh batteries last about tens minutes. Also recommend multi battery charger."
"OR";"Excellent, easy to read ID tags that offer a sense of security for pet parents if a beloved pet inadvertently escapes and gets lost."
"OR";"It's unfortunate from micro USB connector failed after about 35 days of continuous use. If you can't charge it you can't use it. This is a basic design fault."
"OR";"We are lovers of Schleich brand. My 7 year old is obsessed with their horses and accessories. For the last 3 years we have gotten her a Schleich Advent Calendar."
"OR";"I just needed something portable to take away the harshness of my external speedlite for when I cannot take my other equipment with me. I love the velcro strap and that it can fold flat for storage."
"OR";"This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordi"
"OR";"I love having a sneaker that fits.  I would have given them a 5 but one of the questions was does the shoe have good arch support and they have very little arch support."
"OR";"A little bit on the cheesey side but it kept my attention, gave it five stars because I am a big science fiction fan and this one was acceptable."
"OR";"My little Yorkie loves this toy. She plays with it for the longest each time. In fact we have already replaced the batteries in it once..would definitely buy again."
"OR";"Worked very well on my dog who is getting older and needs help with her eyes. Much better than the liquid drops. Soothes quickly."
"OR";"I love this thing. I just got back from a 2 week camping trip and this thing held up perfectly. I was able to keep all of my devices charged and only had to recharge it once in the 2 weeks while keeping 3 phones, a tablet and an electric toothbrush topped off."
"OR";"Ordered these for a friend who collects this type of thing and she loves the little colorful worry dolls!  I have a set I got in Mexico so got these for her'"
"OR";"If you like Odd you'll love this book.  Once again Dean Koontz hits the bull's-eye with deeply strange and yet completely believable characters."
"OR";"These work well although I find the wire to insulation ratio a bit disproportionate.

Im glad they come in a 10 pack :)"
"OR";"As others have noted, this is an exhaustive study of rabies. At times it feels as if the author googled ""rabies"" and then felt compelled to expound upon each and every one."
"OR";"Cats love this -- better than any other cat food I have tried to feed them. I like that it has some greens in it. Cats do eat some greens in the wild. Recommend highly."
"OR";"This is a simple to use, realistic stand mixer.  The quality seems high and my kids have had great fun mixing like mom and dad!"
"OR";"It fit exactly as I wanted it to. I'm only giving it a 4 because for some odd reason, they put the tag on the outside of the butt. I couldn't think of any logical reasoning for this because there are a million other spots that this tag could go. It looked like I had a tail so I cut it off."
"OR";"These are fun, colorful, and sturdy. They have shown no signs of wear or soiling after months of daily use.  Fits my Fitbit One perfectly."
"OR";"I love these women. Goldie Hawn is a huge inspiration to me and Bette Midler is amazing. This cast is just great and the movie is really funny."
"OR";"Holds the morrell elite super duper good & is very sturdy.  The super duper bag does rest on the bottom bar of the stand just a bit though.  Went together easy & going on 3 months of heavy use with no issues so far!"
"OR";"Talk about a game changer... this product has been outstanding!  Its the best adult version of an Easy Bake Oven!  We love Tater Tots! Cheerz!"
"OR";"The Jeffersons is one of the funniest shows ever made. I bought the Complete First Season from Amazon.com a few weeks ago, and I just love it. I hope that the other ten seasons are released on DVD. If you havne't seen the Jeffersons yet, then I suggest watching it."
"OR";"This was for our 18 month grand son and he really enjoys it, It is soft, he can chew on it and it is nice and quiet to take to church. It appears very durable also"
"OR";"The chalk breaks pretty easy but all chalk does. I wish the paint brushes were bigger but I can save these for later for now and use the bigger ones I bought."
"OR";"Purchased as a gift for our son. Fit snug, as was recommended. He has climbed in them several times now and really likes them. Good quality for the price,"
"OR";"I've been using this product for over a year and is pretty satisfied with it.  The dispenser is not not so sturdy so handle with care.  However, it is easy to take out and install the refill bags.  The bags are overall durable but be careful not to overload it or else it'll break apart."
"OR";"Im a firm believer in a workbook for every kid...I hate worksheets...they are unorganized, they get lost. This is a good basic workbook for social studies."
"OR";"Works with my Almond+ Router. Setup is simple and all features work as described. Can't comment on durability. I have it installed in an enclosed outdoor light fixture."
"OR";"I can't count of the number of times I've been able to squeeze into a tight spot with this ratchet.  It has a nice sturdy construction and the thick ""grippy"" handle lets you spin it even when the handle is at nearly a 90 degree angle."
"OR";"These are great! Using them for storage on an open shelf and it keeps things clean while still looking nice and organized. Perfect for what I needed them for!"
"OR";"Nice simple and funny. Good movie for the late night when you just want to enjoy a movie without trying to think heavily!"
"OR";"What a gorgeous rug! Looks beautiful under my small round dining room table.  A great value for the price. Very plush and expensive looking."
"OR";"Your local HVAC contractor will probably charge you 4x this price. My original had worn out pivot posts so it was stuck closed. This was an easy quick replacement."
"OR";"If you are interested in getting a feeling for the awful events that plagued Rwanda during the genocide acts recently - this is a great presentation of the events, based on my knowledge. It is kind of documentary and drama blended together.

What is striking, given the date of this review, is just h"
"OR";"These things are kind of cool but whatever dish you're trying to seal better be dry. They seal pretty well with glass or corelle dishes, not so great with anything metal. Again, make sure your container is dry for forget these things."
"OR";"some what complicated and very difficult to understand the plot at times, at least the ending was ok. never did understand what really happened to Greys young girl sidekick."
"OR";"My girls love it. Excellent customer service! My only complaint is it's super easy to come apart. The part the doll lays on keeps falling."
"OR";"I use this thing all the time.  It is smooth and functions very well.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking to diversify the ab routine a little."
"OR";"I've used this camera ever since attending a One Direction concert. It made the concert so memorable because of the hi def recording feature. The pictures all turned out wonderful. It's an easy camera to use and I'm very happy with my purchase"
"OR";"I had been looking somewhere else at these; they were a lot more expensive there. Then I decided to look on Amazon, and they were way less! They are being used as decoration now, but my son will be using them in the future."
"OR";"Bought for my six year old because it was small enough that he could put it together completely by himself by following the directions. He loves the set!"
"OR";"Exactly as advertised. I used these as a decoration for my sons construction party but I feel like they could even be used for sports drills and such. Very sturdy."
"OR";"Guys a little bugger than expected but not big enough to warrant a size up ... but close. Super comfy and works great with leggings."
"OR";"The metal logo gets really hot as you drink some hot beverages using this cup. You need to be careful. Otherwise, I love the cup."
"OR";"This was a super fun read! Will it Winn a Pulitzer, No...Will it brighten a vacation or beach day, YES!!! This was a whimsical little read. I like different types of books, but every now and then, you want something a little silly. Some of it was a little too 'out there', but as a whole it was fun!"
"OR";"Lexi really knows how to hook her audience! This is a captivating, sexy love story that keeps me turning the page to see what happens next!"
"OR";"I love the story.  I was waiting for a very dramatic ending. Like a matter of life ending but the one that was presented was also nice and funny."
"OR";"Does the job.  Price is right. I am sure there are higher quality adjustment tools out there, but I am no gunsmith and will only change out 3 sights so fits the bill perfectly."
"OR";"Great shoes, as expected, as ordered. Not much by way of traction or support, but that's not what I'm looking for - I'm looking for something casual and flexible (not literally, but... that too). These will last me somewhere between 6 and 12 months, which is fair for the miles I will put on them."
"OR";"My son loves these, he is an above average height 5 year old. They are definitely a little small on coverage, but this allows them to not get in the way but still protect him.  They are easy for him to get on and off himself, and WAY better than those super annoying and utterly terrible sock shingua"
"OR";"It takes a while to get this shirt on because it is tight and will twist up in the arms as you pull it on. But once you get it sorted out, it feels great. Compresses without digging in or being constrictive."
"OR";"These straps are factory replacement straps for Moultrie game cameras.  Animals like the chew on the straps so they need replacement from time to time. These straps have stayed tight and worked well for me.  It took awhile to receive them after I placed my order."
"OR";"this is a must have for any emergency kit. it stores small and works amazingly effective with ease of on the fly adjustment. its also extremely easy to use"
"OR";"I was about to purchase this item until I noticed that ALL BUT 2 of their feedback ratings are all listed within a day or two of each other.  If you click on each reviewer, you will see they have only reviewed this one item in their entire history.  6 of 8 of the reviews here clearly seem to be ille"
"OR";"A fun movie that at times is very violent/gory but with great action sequences. Sometimes the plot veers off its track but it's still a fun waste of time."
"OR";"I debated about this table or a larger one. Probably should have purchased one a little larger. Storage, set up is very simple, quality is perfect."
"OR";"This box set was a great read. You can't go wrong with this purchase. All 7 stories were great. My favorites out of this box set were Heart Raider, Warrior's Bride and Crazy in Love. Those three stories were great!!! You won't regret this purchase."
"OR";"I wanted a simple popcorn popper and the Salbree popcorn popper works great.  I love that it flattens down for easy storage."
"OR";"The premise behind implementing business systems into the operation a business is based on human nature.

People need to have well defined systems that can be replicated.

Franchises owe their success to well defined business systems."
"OR";"I will NOT buy anymore FOX shows till seasons 5/6 are released. They did the same with Mary Tyler Moore.  SO UNFAIR. Two tv classics. I wish to complete my collection and if you can release 4, you can release 6 seasons......"
"OR";"It contains accurate info but the info it contains is so broad that it skims over most of US History--I guess a textbook is supposed to to that in a general sense, but as a professor I found it lacking and wouldn't have chose this one for my course. I see that it comes with nice online components an"
"OR";"Bought these for an iPhone 4.  They sound great, fit comfortably, and the button works intuitively. Recommended as a nice replacement for iPhone/iPod."
"OR";"I ordered these bags and was sent some cheap Version and knock off. I am terribly disappointed in what they sent me. But of course at this price point it's not worth my time to it send back."
"OR";"Lacey wants her stepbrother to give her an injection, and hes got just what shes been longing for. Great characters, fun, sexy read."
"OR";"This I read for the book club I'm in and it sounded great, but then when I first got it I was a little overwhelmed at the size, I think because it was a hardback and so large. But I found I enjoyed it all the way through, the characters are real and have flaws, very humans ones at that considering t"
"OR";"I've never used a clear treatment that actually keeps 100% of fleas off my dogs. But the idea is that they bite the medicated dog and die so they don't reproduce in my carpet and infest my house and that hasn't been a problem so that's a win lol"
"OR";"Lot of twists in this who done it.  So many character's that at times it was mind boggling but in a good way.  An amazing read that I was unable to put down."
"OR";"Bedford's handbook is quite handy for a non-expert.  Anyone who's going to be teaching Shakespeare but hasn't written a dissertation on him ought to pick one up."
"OR";"Ugh, what to say? You gutted me. The begging was a little Rocky for me, however when I started reading my dad went into icu. It quickly picked up and sucked me in just when the carpet was pulled out from under my feet.awesome read and can't wait for more. Thankfully I have time to heal lol."
"OR";"Heavy duty.  Built to hold a holster or other tactical supplies.  Well made and durable.  I'm not sure how the velcro will hold up with time."
"OR";"These are good except they develop holes in the wash/dry cycle.  it could be my washer/dryer.  3-1/2 stars b/c of the low price & they still work."
"OR";"I bought this for the TTL ... then I realized that the best results can be achieved only in Manual ...
The other problem, it doesn't support HSS which is a mandatory for shooting in the daylight (flash as fill)"
"OR";"OK, good air combat scenes. That's out of the way now.

There is no discernible story worth caring about and NONE of the actors roused me to root for or care about them. The movie just goes on insufferably from one disconnected, disjointed scene to the next.

There is no structure to this film other"
"OR";"This is a couch doctor who majors in quizzical looks and doesn't accept anything on face value.  Each episode is a stand-alone doctor/patient exchange without diagnosis or treatment.  I just don't have the endurance to see if he really ever treats successfully."
"OR";"This is a very sturdy steamer with nice features. I like the silicone-coated legs which prevent scratches in the pan, in fact, that is the reason I chose it. I use the steamer basket for hard cooking eggs. The detachable handle in the center is a premium feature."
"OR";"My 8 year old absolutely loves this watch! It not only takes pictures, but has little games on it too. He loved the flame wrist band the most."
"OR";"After trying a half dozen different types of goggles, these were the clear winner. We've purchased them for all the children in the family and these are the only ones that are comfortable enough to wear all day and do not leak at all. They also have an ingenious method for easily so easily sizing th"
"OR";"Like the first two books, this book has plenty of action.  Not necessarily a book to read before you go to bed because it is a page turner."
"OR";"I bought it twenty years ago, and still refer to it. I bought another copy to give to a friend who's getting started on juicing."
"OR";"I'm sorry, but this book is a waste.  It has an interesting enough premise, but then it doesn't really go anywhere.  The writing fair and I might well give the author another chance if she comes up with another book, but this certainly isn't a good debut."
"OR";"Fast exciting book.  Author writes an WSU to read and follow story with interesting characters to enjoy and figure out story

To"
"OR";"I don't know why the picture looks the way it does, the real necklace looks like your standard plastic crystal necklace, its very pretty and durable."
"OR";"This book a amazing. I didn't want to put it down. The only bad thing I can say about the book is it ended. It was perfect from being to end. The story is very believable."
"OR";"I read this book years ago and I still find myself talking about it and recommending to friends. It is a wonderful story and reminds us that not everyone sat by and did nothing during the holacaust. Many people risked their lives to do the right thing. I recommend this book highly."
"OR";"these shoes are ok but you get what you pay for.  they look cheap and are made cheap but if your looking for a shoe to wear briefly or to match an outfit these will do fine."
"OR";"Super sturdy and heavy, the exact dimensions I needed for a bedside table. The 3 drawers open and close effortlessly and hold a considerable amount. The pull out tray slides easily and is perfect for holding the occasional drink."
"OR";"Sigh, these remotes are fragile. It worked well. Remember to re- pair the blu-tooth/wireless connection by taking off the back cover and holding down the blue button."
"OR";"Enjoyed this so much. Interesting. Written in 3 voices/points of view.
About a racial issue in modern society, and dealt with well. Not difficult to read."
"OR";"Space bar is junk. It responds if only hit dead center. Plan to buy a better key board in the near future and toss this one."
"OR";"Highly engaging tale of the human side of espionage, risks taken, and prices paid. Well documented, and photos from the archives bring it home."
"OR";"If you are a reader who enjoys the challenge of a time sequence that is replete with starts and stops you will enjoy this novel. Set in pre- WWI England, the main character, Ursula, repeatedly dies and then is reborn into a new life.  Everything she did previously is lived again with the exception o"
"OR";"Good quality but the ruffle was too tight on my calf. Although I do have a wider than average calf. Would fit some one with average to slender legs."
"OR";"It's hard to describe the feeling I get every time i use this thing.  Make Salsa and guacamole with your favorite veggies in mere seconds."
"OR";"A collection of stories inspired by the ""unsolved mysteries"" of ancient women. This book FASCINATED me. Ms. Guillaume took bits of history and asked ""what if?"" We don't often think of ancient women proposing a theeesome or sexually dominating a brand-new husband, but Guillaume leads readers to belie"
"OR";"My 21 month old, 50 pound lab mix needs something to chew on every day. He chews between 30 minutes to one hour daily. Most toys he can destroy in a day or less. This includes the giant ropes! The only chew toys that last are heavy duty Kong toys and these Nylabones. He prefers the nylabones and rar"
"OR";"I wavered on whether to purchase or not. I even almost cancelled the order. So glad I didn't. These are very pretty- whimsical. I hung them in my master bath. They're beautiful."
"OR";"Bought it for a friend's new born 2 years ago, the mom and baby loves it. Buy it again for another friend's new born."
"OR";"I have had 3 pairs of this headset. I lost one, bought one for my wife, and bought myself a replacement. As a mono bluetooth it works great, although a bit on the heavy side. As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many"
"OR";"This worked awesome for creating ""lunch boxes"" with the Leftover Thanksgiving dinner! I will admit, I was a little leery with the construction of the lid, but once I have it secured, I haven't had any issues."
"OR";"The band comes with small screwdriver and fits Garmin Fenix 3 perfectly well.  It feels essentially like the original band."
"OR";"I've had these products for a month now and I've experienced no foreseeable problems. The charger does as intended and the battery replacements are nifty when you don't have electricity {SEAsia}."
"OR";"One of many excellent squeeze balls available. Put it in a bowl with a remote next to your favorite TV chair and work those hands!"
"OR";"Not damn this thing is a good deal more gun case than I expected when I bought it. If I went boating I could chuck this thing in the water and tether it to me and it would all be fine on the other end. Tough as nails. Water PROOF, not resistant. Outstanding value."
"OR";"My dog loooves this toy, basically 3 toys in one he love to search for the squirrels, or just play with the log or the squirrels by themselves. They are not super sturdy so I do not think this would be great for a heavy chewer but our little guy does not like the destroy his toys so it is good for h"
"OR";"Great battery life, it actually is able to maintain it's own charge and charge another device in full sun, love it for around the pool!!!"
"OR";"Although Salander singlehandedly can save most series, this one was a stretch.  The characters are shallow, the dialogue is nonexistent, and the story is told, not allowed to develop."
"OR";"I hate it because it arrived broken, and to get a replacement or refund I have to return it.  It was $17 - not worth my time to take it to UPS or the post office so I'm tossing it.  Bad quality control.  I have no idea if it would work and I probably won't find out."
"OR";"I love the inspirational scriptures and how the characters lean on God. My only complaint after reading this whole series...the problems between the couple dragging out too long...I understand misunderstandings as how they happen but when you are reading these stories, they seem to duplicate just wi"
"OR";"Very Nice for a low cost Bluetooth Headset.  Sound quality isn't too bad for it's cost, distance on Bluetooth Range in house around walks was twenty feet,  and voice assistance for power and connections is a nice feature."
"OR";"I knew I got a good deal when my usually taciturn Russian tailor said ""beautiful coat."" Since then I've had many compliments. Great value for the price. Works great summer, fall and winter - nice, light fabric."
"OR";"LOVE THIS calculator!!!  all the functions OMG~~~ one thing tho, make sure that your kids don't get it. it will ruin them. Only get it if you understand the math behind the functions that you are looking to use., if not, it makes life too easy. which, it is handy, but deters learning"
"OR";"A nice story about young love.  Using fruitcake as part of a love story would never occur to me but it worked here."
"OR";"Well nice history but oferta was too short i mean you cant do that to someone put the esenario the good plot an just end it that fas"
"OR";"Amazing earrings especially for the price.  They are dainty but the color of the stones is good, the clasp is good.  I can't even believe they were an add on item!"
"OR";"Nice and bright when in spot mode, but still has those wide angle LEDs for basic work around camp. Overall good light."
"OR";"This is one of the best fly boxes that I have seen. Snaps tight with water proof seal all around. Slim enough not to get in the way."
"OR";"Fun game that even my 4 year old granddaughter can enjoy. I had the older version from years ago, and this works just as well."
"OR";"Ordered these last minute take our Phoenix baby up to snowy cold Flagastaff. They kept his little hands nice and toasty!"
"OR";"This kit was an awesome learning tool for the summertime. All the caterpillars we received turned into butterflies. My son, who was 5 at the time, didn't like the maintenance much, but he loved releasing them. We were worried about 1 that was almost caught by a bird, but it added to the excitement :"
"OR";"Another very good read from Diana DeRicci.  Very well written and very sweet.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a sweet HEA."
"OR";"Clients love these sheets. They feel ""high end"". Holding up well with frequent washing. No staining. Buy these if you like to spoil your clients!"
"OR";"All snails arrived alive and well, been in my tank for 4 days now. took a couple snails a day or so to become active but happy with purchase."
"OR";"I bought it for ny pregnancy photo shoot.
Pros:
Beautiful color (bought red one)
Very good material
The flow of the dress is really nice!
Looks fabulous
Perfect fit!

Cons:
Absolutely nothing!

Value for money."
"OR";"Lifesaver in times of power outage in a developing country. I just attach it to my battery pack and it lasts all night without taking up charge from the battery pack ."
"OR";"Finger Prints are always visable & no matter haw well put put in on. The air bubble seem to follow. I highly Do Not Recommend."
"OR";"My cats love salmon but don't care too much for gravy or chunks Even the feral cats
Dont want to chew too much"
"OR";"Quality Product made with Quality Materials. I won't need to replace this set it is going to last a long, long time"
"OR";"I can't believe how much the dogs loved this toy. It makes noise by almost any movement and doesn't have an on/off switch. There's a little slot where a plastic tab prevents the noise from happening, but it would be better with an actual switch."
"OR";"Excellent product - best value in it's class, I believe. The lobster design is the warmest you can get and still have that index finger useable for shooting a rifle or whathaveyou.  Work equally well for winter skiing or extreme cold hunting."
"OR";"Beautiful and perfect for holding all of mommies things in the diaper bag! I love jujube. I have two of their diaper bags along with multiple other products."
"OR";"Very nice radio, except I can't see it during the day time.  The glare is unbelievable and it's so dim it can hardly be seen.

At night it's great, if not a little too bright.  The dim adjustments are not adequate for day/night.

Other than that it's a great sounding radio with plenty of features."
"OR";"This thing is the coolest!! It's perfect for my little hands, doesn't have a complicated lock to close, and exactly what I was looking for. I've been wanting a small versatile knife. It exceeded my expectations,  and it will be used daily.

I received a discount in return for my honest review."
"OR";"excellent lens. a must have lens for your gears. it creates incredible bokeh, good quality images, and so wonderful colors. very good for portrait."
"OR";"My cat DC was way overweight so we put her on Purina one Salmon and Tuna flavor. She is losing weight and more active than she was eating Seafood sensations and Fancy Feast Gravy lovers. She is getting used to it and seems to like it ok"
"OR";"I just love the sas and wit that the strong females bring to these books. I enjoyed this book just as much as the 1st, and am now going to read the third."
"OR";"My dog, Molly is very adept at solving problems and will work at something for hours until she gets what she wants!  When I got home after many hours away, the garbage can was dragged into the middle of the living room, and the lock remained secure!  I am so happy with this product!"
"OR";"I have a student who loves Scooby-Doo. I gave him the movie as a gift. We watched the movie together. I can honestly say the movie was cute and funny."
"OR";"Apparently such a simple setup is very hard to do. Easy to install, but the audio quality left something to be greatly desired. Static, buzzing, and over-amplified volume."
"OR";"Very nice, good weight, better than the other darts I've purchased. Boring design (shark-fin) but easy to buy other flights on Amazon."
"OR";"This is the Mercedes of home networking routers. Fills my house with a strong signal. the 5GHz band is perfect with my Nvidia SHIELD. Great management interface."
"OR";"SIZE IS NOT ACCURED, YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN THE BUYERS THAT IF YOU ARE SIZE 10, YOU NEED TO ORDER SIZE 11 AND WIDE, BECAUSE I HAVE NORMAL FEET AND THIS DID NOT FIT ME AT ALL."
"OR";"They are real light and comfortable. My feet felt fine all day especially standing on concrete floors for the most part.
Will by others in different colors."
"OR";"This book gives you a very specific guide on how to do your own mini-farm, it's really detailed so this book is really for beginners. I've been trying several days to star my own mini farm and this book gave me the tips to be able to really do it! It's really easy to read and understand."
"OR";"Promptly delivers, no qualms about anything else.

Great boot, I wear it all the time now.

It works for the office environment and I can use it as casual wear."
"OR";"She is small and soft with a lot of curly hair.  Easy to carry, comfortable to hold.  Her hair is a very curly synthetic that isn't going to last long since our grand daughter has an urge to brush it.  It's cute enough, but not practically functional."
"OR";"perhaps i need some camera movement - there was none
i watched this movie because i heard it was a visual feast. the colors were all washed out as if this was a digital version of a VHS tape."
"OR";"Used to mount a BSA scope with weaver rings on a Ruger M77 357. Very easy installation and standard tools required. No alterations required."
"OR";"enjoyed this book.  I love the history of the old mansion and the description of the inside ruins and also how it looked 70 years prior."
"OR";"The copper Porkpie hat was a perfect fit and the color is great. I didn't get a feather with the hat and usually a feather would be with the item."
"OR";"This is really a well made rope and i have been practicing for double unders at home. Great price too. Packaged well and came on time."
"OR";"What to say without spoiling it.... amazing. Ful of action, killings,dirty crooked cops, second chances, old loves never ever dies.no matter the distance, setting wrongs rights, with a little guy to bring in the laughs."
"OR";"I use this to lift up a foldable trailer.  The rope is pretty rough and gloves are necessary.  It provides enough mechanical advantage to lift the tongue of the trailer up to vertical."
"OR";"Great product, well packaged. Love the colors, going to use for so many different things. The possibilities are endless, very happy"
"OR";"christmas gift so i took it out of the box to charge it up ( no waiting after opened ) & tried it out after the proper charging time & loved it. I'm sure my nephew will too."
"OR";"OMG you didn't just leave me with that Cliffhanger! Ugh! Groan! Cry!

First off I have to tell Amelie S. Duncan that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED Piper Dreams!  You can ask my husband how many times I moved out of my chair since I started reading this book.  I think 3 times just for potty breaks and lunch!  I"
"OR";"I don't really see giving this less than 4 or 5 stars.  The story
is powerful.  The message of 'by hurting yourself you also hurt
others in your life,' is presented well.  If you're interested in
a movie that gives you something to think about, it's worth the time."
"OR";"I waited months to read this through my local library and it was totally worth it. Great book. One of those that stays with you long after the last page"
"OR";"Keyword:  TUNITY
If you use the app Tunity on your phone to tune into and listen to TV channels on your phone via the Bluetooth speaker in a loud bar, then be ready to be disappointed.  I bought this specifically to listen to Bellator MMA (Spike TV/Paramount) while I was at my local bar.  The bar pl"
"OR";"It's somewhat large but not worth sending back  scrubs are always difficult to fit believe it or not!  Brand makes a big difference and where they are made.  check the label...been wearing scrubs for MANY years.  Cherokee has a better quality of fabric though."
"OR";"If you enjoy the writing style and clarity of previous Joyce Meyer books, you're sure to enjoy this latest book as well."
"OR";"Baked items release so easily from this pan.  Ordered two.  Clean up was a breeze.  Cannot ask for more.  Now even my packaged cakes rise higher since using 8 inch pan instead of 9 or 10 inch."
"OR";"Love the main character. I wish we got an explanation of the voice inside her head. Her relationship with Ryan is what makes this book great."
"OR";"These are lovely male wraps. My little dog wears one inside, as he can't seem to understand that it's not ok to lift his leg in the house."
"OR";"was a tad difficult to put together, because some directions were sorta vague. Other than it looks like it does in the picture and is a great place to hide a kitty box."
"OR";"Bought The Satechi SD Mini & the X-Mini Happy from Amazon.

The X-Mini Happy was $28 more (at the time)
and also came with a 2GB SD Card (mini with adapter)
plus Earphones (Plug Type).

Both came with a Pull String Carry Sack.

I loaded 2 SD cards with the same MP3s,

"OR";"Great light weight little cutting board. Wish they made this one in the bigger size. Goes right in the dishwasher."
"OR";"I had first seen this toy at a local pharmacy and almost bought it right then after seeing how great it was, but then I decided to purchase it off of Amazon as it was cheaper!"
"OR";"Good pointed air pellets I use all types of 177 cal pellets for different uses and these are good for target small game"
"OR";"Wow - this shirt runs very small. Glad I read the reviews to order up a size.  I usually wear a small or medium and ordered a large.  It definitely fits like a small.  It's nice fabric and very stretchy so I'll keep it.  It is such a flattering style!!"
"OR";"The kid loves Halo MegaBloks right now, and these are some cool additions. The Flood characters get a lot of mileage around the house, and the interchangeable parts ensure I will eventually find a zombie Master Chief underfoot in the middle of the night."
"OR";"This has been a nice little grill for making family breakfast. I like that it is none stick and has the cooling boundary around it. Bacon takes a while to cook on it but pancakes and eggs are fast. Decent to clean, wish it was dish washer safe. Over all very happy with it."
"OR";"I ordered this cape for myself for my birthday and it is amazing, I love it! I saw a similar one at Macy's that was twice the price and I am so glad I waited for this one to arrive instead, it looks even better than it does online. I ordered a large but the seller sent a medium (prob because sold ou"
"OR";"I had one of these exact covers a few years back in a plum color and I absolutely loved it so when I updated my bedding I new I had to have another one of these!"
"OR";"I use this for taking long walks or hikes and it's been great. I never went more than a few miles and avoided going out when it was very hot. I don't like carrying a water bottle in my pocket or holding it in my hand. This is a nice out-of-the-way method and the bottles are small enough to not be no"
"OR";"The story of a man who built a denisty in Colorado Springs.  The many family members he loves and the dream of peace, security and love he hopes for."
"OR";"I love this mat it was well worth every penny it helped me a lot with rolling the fondant and placing on the cake. It helps it not get dried out."
"OR";"I made that word up to sound like a musical excellent! Really good book. Thanks Mitch for the great read!"
"OR";"IMO Kester is my gold standard in solder.  Heats and flows easily, consistently and predictablly.  Other solders will do the job, but Kester is my favorite for consistency and ease of use."
"OR";"Beautiful set. Sadly, one of the bowls was broken on arrival. It would be a good thing if the inside of the box had a layer of small bubble wrap or something. Other than that I am so happy with this purchase!  Holding perfect portion sizes and is really nicely constructed too."
"OR";"This movie has become quite rare.  It's set in a parallel world of Hollywood Babylon in the late thirties.  The shocking climax never fails each time."
"OR";"I love this collection, it has several westerns that I had planned to purchase in one of my future orders, getting them all in collection of movies just made my day."
"OR";"I love these books! I love the way all 3 series groups inter-mingle each with the other.  All these characters are easy to love and their stories are gripping and keeps you interested through the end.
Great job with all these guys and their gals!  Cant wait to read Michael and Nikki's story and the "
"OR";"I was looking for a two point sling for my D.D. AR . Found one on Amazon at a great price. So I ordered it. I got it and I am very happy with it."
"OR";"Arrived ontime and as advertised. Fill with glue, roll onto work smoothly, clean up with ease. Be happy as this roller works very well."
"OR";"I am a fan of Neil Gaiman but missed this one until I saw a Facebook post talking about it, and like that I was hooked. And then I started reading it and the rabbit hole closed up on me fast! What an absolutely brilliant otherworld to visit (for me just about 4 days because I couldn't put it down)."
"OR";"Rosanne Bittner is a good story teller.  Since I live in the Northwest, I especially enjoyed  the last book, The Oregon Bride."
"OR";"The die itself is fine. I just was trying to get one that would expand the brass to .358 for loading coated 9mm bullets. This is still too small for that."
"OR";"Go get this series... and the La Patron Series!!! Your missing out on life if you haven't read a Sydney Addae book yet!!"
"OR";"What an amazing pair of shoes, I love Jambu. it is stylish, super light and comfy. the laser cut is so trendy. The price was the best on Amazon."
"OR";"been wearing Carhartt rain gear for years, great clothing,
they do run a bit ""bigger"" but that is because I believe they are designed that way so it fits over clothing"
"OR";"Crimson Eve, the 3rd book in Brandilyn Collins' Kanner Lake series, has been in my TBR stack for quite some time.  I read Violet Dawn (nicknamed Violent Dawn by my book club) and Amber Morn quite a while ago, but was not lost when I started this novel.  Really, they could probably be read as stand-a"
"OR";"Really good book. I really loved it it hard to put away once you get started. Had one of those really twists to it."
"OR";"I got this for my daughter who is dressing up as Ms. Frizzle from the Magic Schoolbus books. She is creating a great costume and Liz here will be her prop. I rearely write a review, but this thing is SUPER cute, and quite a bit larger than I'd expected. We love ""Lizzie."
"OR";"Sprayed on cats and dogs yesterday, found a tick today on one of the dogs. Ticks don't bother me as much as the fleas do so I hope this stuff works on them better than it did the ticks. Smell was fine, not to strong and hasn't irritated any of the pets."
"OR";"After much research (and waffling) I held my breath and ordered these bars along with the Sunlite Steel stem and was able to convert my craigslist 1986 Schwinn LeTour mixte to a fully upright riding position.  As I said in my review of the stem, I was so happy when I sat on the bike after the conver"
"OR";"My husband wears these while bird watching.  They are light weight & have a good grip for binoculars.  They are a stretchy neoprene type fabric.  They are not super warm gloves but plenty for cool fall & early winter days.

They fit true to size."
"OR";"It's a great rug for the bathroom!! Doesn't move at all on the tile and soaks up the water that goes onto the rug after you step on it from exiting the shower/bathtub. Wish the brand would make them in a larger size though.  Overall a great bathroom rug."
"OR";"Interesting ..but not Poe. Not what  I expected. I guess I was expecting something more traditional. I'm sure you work will appeal to a different audiences. Good luck."
"OR";"I like using it, light and sturdy, cutting cheese and truffles well, good find adjustments, nice solid metal."
"OR";"Awesome boot. Totally rugged and 100%water proof. I was up to my ankles in puddles of slush and water and ice/snow. I kept expecting to feel cold water rush in but it never happened and my feet stayed pretty warm. Amazing."
"OR";"This was very easy to apply to our 100 lb dog, and we haven't seen a flea on him since we applied it.  It also doesn't seem to be greasy, and hasn't attracted any dirt.  We don't notice any odor.  All in all, it seems to be working just fine.  I will buy more in the future."
"OR";"I have back issues in the L1-L3 region and these help keep those issues at bay and are way more comfortable to wear than any other NB shoe I have worn so far."
"OR";"Well written. Great descriptions. Kept me enthralled. Liked the way characters from the other books were part of the story. Loved it."
"OR";"I have this sitting in a bucket which I use to circulate clweaner then sanitizer, then water through the three lines on my beer tap system. Quiet and works well."
"OR";"I had so much fun reading Confessor Joe, Book Two. I thought Book One was funny, but I found this funnier. The author was good in creating vivid scenes for her characters. Good read for those feeling down. I like the way she ended Book Two."
"OR";"Very good quality leather belt for CCW holster use. Much more affordable than what some well known custom leather shops are charging."
"OR";"Sorry action fans but this one is a dud.. Confusing in its never ending attempt to have action scenes. they were just jumbled together until they reached 90 minutes."
"OR";"Excellent read for anyone who has questions and wants to ponder the answers.  This is a book that needs you to use your mind, but gives good results."
"OR";"One of the great benefits of Prime on Amazon is being able to see old classics like this.  Love the series and the opportunity to watch it again."
"OR";"Such a fun toy! We got this for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She loves having a drill set and switching the drill's rotation to screw/unscrew. The case is really cute and I love that it holds everything and has a convenient handle. This offers lots of fun play time!"
"OR";"This is quite simply the best smelling candle in the world.
Actually, it is the best smelling ANYTHING in the world.

I'm not really a candle person, but this is unbelievable!"
"OR";"Definitely not my favorite. I don't think I'll get this for my dog again after she's finished with this bag. These meatballs are very soft and get stuck in her teeth. It caused her some discomfort for several minutes after eating it. I think we are best with sticking with crunchy snacks."
"OR";"I have a 12 year old lab who will not eat dry food any more.  Getting her to eat has been a constant struggle and she was losing so much weight.  She loves Whole Earth and I can actually get her to eat more dry food with this brand than any other! She loves all the flavors too!"
"OR";"love the shoe and fits well.  I have narrow feet so there is a bit of gap but not noticeable.  Only problem is they squeak when I walk.  Wonder about WD-40 on the sisal -:)"
"OR";"Not really what I expected - far more into the sci-fi/fantasy realm than I was anticipating, having never read Neil Gaiman before. I did really enjoy the book. Nice vivid descriptions, imaginative story. I was really wondering how the boy was ever going to escape from the evil nanny!"
"OR";"But it isn't obnoxious.  Sort of thing that people just sort of 'discover'  sitting there.
And it works - I desperately needed more USB slots, and this worked.  Not a problem with how it functions.
So it is interesting, people comment on it (or don't, which sorts out Who Knows What), and it works wi"
"OR";"This cage is very flimsy.  Cheap material.  Door latch barely works. Roof not secured.  Spend a little more for a better quality cage!"
"OR";"Kristin Cashore comes up with a wonderfully new concept in the fantasy world and I cannot wait to read her other books.  Not boring moment in the book!"
"OR";"5 stars for just how awesome this product is, especially its versatility.  -1 star for how freaking expensive it is.  For how simple this thing is, it seems a lot overpriced."
"OR";"We have 4 cats. They have all been spayed and/or neutered. One male still sprayed somewhat. We tried the Feliway spray. I'm still trying it out to see is it has any effect, however the plug in units are wonderful and work exceptionally well.  ."
"OR";"It's like the Zombiestrike Sword, only shorter.  But hey, it's a miniature Katana (kuh-tuh-naw).  How cool is that?  Is it worth the dollar increase over the Zombiestrike sword?  Probably not, but to some, having variation is everything."
"OR";"Most of the shower caddies you find in stores these days are kind of big and clunky (presumably for a large family?) but this one is the perfect size!"
"OR";"This is very well made and supportive. Fits my 8 week old 5 lb. frenchie in a small and I bought a medium for the future."
"OR";"Organises well. We did buy it for something else than it was intended for - to store dart supplies in our basement. Segments small odds and ends well."
"OR";"Have had this bag for 2 years, other then some minor stitching issues this is a great pack. I only paid 60 bucks on amazon so it was well worth the money"
"OR";"I have an over weight poodle and he loves his food. He gets just a little more to eat with this food verse  the foods that are not reduced fat and he has dropped  2 to 3 lbs over this past year .  He is a small dog but  hopefully he drops 1 or 2 more lbs."
"OR";"This was an interesting book and I really enjoyed how Elise didn't freak out when she saw Dietrich in his bear form. These two hit it off right away."
"OR";"It's a fairly entertaining game.  It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules, and about 30 to play.  The rules are simple and there is a little amount of hidden roles to keep people guessing.  The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo.  4 stars because"
"OR";"My grandson loves this!!! Only thing I didn't like was they couldn't wrap it for me and I thought it would come in one piece but you have to put it together."
"OR";"Universal Soldier fans will love Day of Reckoning. The tone of this film is very cryptic and the content is both action packed and graphic. Precision choreography coupled with authentic Martial Artists enables Day of Reckoning to live up to its franchise."
"OR";"A well depicted story of the historical times. Strong characters with captivating descriptions of a desperate time in history.  A good story."
"OR";"I love this & I can't wait for more.
I will be also leaving a review on Goodreads @ Amazon.
And letting everyone know about it.
So i gave it a 5 Stars."
"OR";"These litter boxes help keep the litter we use in the box, even with two cats! The sides are high, but not too high that the cats mind."
"OR";"I rolled my kayak coming in from the ocean to the beach and broke my existing paddle. I bought this one as a replacement and, for the price, wasn't expecting much. I am very happy with this. It not only comes apart, but is very sturdy and has the little grooves to bring yourself closer to a dock or "
"OR";"This stuff is amazing!!  Used it to tape off my walls before we scraped the popcorn ceiling texture off, and it was SO slick to put up!  The plastic is thin though, so we had to be careful not to get the tape stuck to the plastic when trying to unroll and apply it.  But it worked like a charm!"
"OR";"Terrible. They claim these are Stainless Steel but are cheap aluminum. I wouldn't hang a picture of these things, let alone swings or weights. Go to Home Depot or any hardware store and buy the real, heavy duty thing."
"OR";"Great book on Scientology. Couldn't put it down. It does a very good job of talking about the history of Scientology and its founder L Ron Hubbard."
"OR";"Only used it once over the last 5 months, but it didn't disappoint. It was actually in a race, so instead of losing 10 minutes on a flat, after 3 minutes I was on the saddle again."
"OR";"I really enjoyed this romance book.  Selena and Peter are really likable characters and I enjoyed their interaction together.  Selena was a free spirit who could not stay at one job for long and Peter longed for her.  I enjoyed their story and it was a fun read."
"OR";"I love every book T.S Joyce has witten! But this polar bear shifter LOVe story will capture your heart.............
This is an AWESOME book !!!!!! I Loved it. I hope there are more polar bear shifter stories to come in
 The future. GREAT read !!!!! you have to read this one !!!!!!"
"OR";"For the Hornady ultrasonic cleaner.  This is for gun parts ONLY,.  Do Not use it on brass casings, nor the brass casing cleaner on gun parts.  Always use distilled water.  Technically not needed, but it will keep the machine much cleaner in the long run."
"OR";"I don't know how so many lumens can be produced by a light using 1 AAA battery.  Quality could not be better.  A little pricey."
"OR";"Bought these for our LO and he likes them so far. We will see when he's a bit older (7mo). They suck up water & you squirt the kid for endless laughs."
"OR";"Easily edged 3+ homes (I refinish wood floors) with this single blade. No need to carry a file to sharpen like cheaper scrapers."
"OR";"Let Oberon do all the talking, and kill off Granuaile; One can see her PC stupidity coming from a long way off. She has become a  worthless character."
"OR";"I really enjoyed REVENGE of the WROUGHT-IRON FLAMINGOS, enough that I have recommended, not only this book, but the series to others. I literally found myself guffawing outloud during the scene where the murderer is caught. The series is a good read for those who like mystery, a little romance and a"
"OR";"Nice twists, but too much focus on piggy over eating.  The characters are well developed otherwise.  Enjoyable book for a rainy day."
"OR";"Best EDC for Work I ever bought. Can cut with the nose by pushing or us it as scraper.  Strong little knife.  I love it."
"OR";"I've been using it on my A65 for several months and really enjoyed it, as have all others viewing the pictures that come from it. Great for portraits of children."
"OR";"This is an amazing story. I really liked the characters. I am hoping to read the whole series. I am into the romance novels and there are not many that are with detective novels mixed in."
"OR";"This is great Leash for training. It is light enough not to bother my dog and heavy enough that it does not get tangled up. The padded handle is great."
"OR";"Does the job well. No flaws, what so ever. Fits nice, isolates ambient noise. Still need some time to justify for its quality."
"OR";"Using these for a birthday party in June.  But, of course, I had to open them and check them out.  They are a good variety and at a great price.  I am sure they will be a hit at the birthday party."
"OR";"I was looking for something that could be put on a quarter round door but it has a rigid back so it won't bend...it's meant strictly for a straight door edge."
"OR";"I absolutely love that Emma follows her heart even though if she feels wrong while doing it. Sometimes doing something seen as ""wrong"" can have an amazing ending and this book is just one of the ways it can happen.  Lucia is an amazing writer and I can't wait to read more of her writing."
"OR";"Love having the zipper. Still comfortable as regular scrub pants but more durable and easy to get in and out of.  (Not having to worry with a knot in the drawstring.) Was told at a local Scrub store that Dickey is discontinuing this style.  I hope they change their mind because they are great for me"
"OR";"This cartridge is a piece of junk. The plastic stop on the stem keeps breaking. Other people have the same problem. (eg read the reviews on the Home Depot webpage.)  You can't even get the plastic stop itself, you have to buy the whole cartridge. Ridiculous."
"OR";"Workings well on low amp machines with extremely good penetration.  Use for thin or light steel components or sheet metal."
"OR";"I replaced the hardware on my bureau and what a change!!
It updated the look.  the items is not large, but a perfect size. The rubbed bronze makes the difference. The item came within days, at least 5 days prior to actually delivery date."
"OR";"Good information to boost your memory! The discussions on how to improve your memory in this book is thorough and the techniques to sharpen your mind is good to implement. I actually learned the different phases of instilling information into our head from this book. A good guide indeed!"
"OR";"The beginning was a little slow but once the story started to gain momentum my attention was caught and kept captivated.  I will definitely be on the look out for Book 2."
"OR";"What a great novel, but I hope it's not a final conclusion.  Where's Peter??  How can Jean Guy solve a crime without Armand's help?  We will all stay tuned."
"OR";"Love the sarcasm and banter between Blake and Jennifer.  However, I could done with less of her dramatics.  Blake has shown time and again that he deserved the good benefit of doubt of his love for Jennifer.  Because love is a powerful emotion that wins every time."
"OR";"Tested it against a glass floated version and it was very close to temperature. Another bonus is, you can rearrange-move it as needed. I use this on both of my tanks. Even if one degree off in either way, it's more important that you keep the temperature consistent when changing your water. Good-qua"
"OR";"It's a very good short story!  I love how the author doesn't try to explain everything and leaves it up to the reader to figure some stuff out as the story progresses.

Worth reading Fluency first as it sets some of the stage for a little background info.  Not that important though."
"OR";"Love this skirt.  Am thinking about getting it in every color.  VERY comfortable.  I now have one in 5 different colors.  Someone said it wrinkles but no more I found than any other skirt.  I use a spray wrinkle release and it is fine.  All that I have bought are the same quality.  Love these.  Can "
"OR";"Used this for a ""broadcast ON-THE-AIR"" sign illluminator and it is very bright, very red(!), the light is evenly dispersed, and uses less than 2 watts!  Love it!"
"OR";"This is the only sequel to place the central figure, Prof. Horatio Smith(Leslie Howard), (Scarlet Pimpernel re-incarnate) a century and then some years in the future. Yet, knowing this, this meticulously restored yarn stands entirely alone in thought-provoking suspense, cat-and-mouse deception and t"
"OR";"Serving its purpose very well. Makes moving photo tripods around much easier. Have not had it for very long but so far it has been holding up great."
"OR";"This inspirational book is a MUST read in my opinion. Awesome true story about God's healing miracles, great and powerful love."
"OR";"Nice collars for the money.  I like the adjustability, so my kittens can grow into them.  The cats lose them once in a while, but I have a Loc8tor tag on each collar, so they're easy to find."
"OR";"Why dirty a storage dish when you can just put some suction on your leftovers?  These are really a clever invention.  It worked the first time and every time.  Too cool."
"OR";"I just discovered this show and LOVE it.  It is delightful, and refreshing, funny and yet still has some tension to make it exciting.  Wish it could go on for more years."
"OR";"I absolutely love these headphones, I am wearing them as I write this review. They may be the best headphones for under $30 on the market. They are not very bassy, but I don't listen to very high bass music anyway. They are great for listening to rock, classical, podcasts, and audiobooks though."
"OR";"This is a great receiver.  I wish it had bluetooth and the ability to stream from an android phone but I knew this going in.  Yamaha seems to make a solid product."
"OR";"Not happy with this product. I left plenty of space around it and it has more dust sticking to the outside than the filter. It doesn't take long for the replacement filter light to come on and the filters are very expensive. I can't say I have noticed a change since using it."
"OR";"Unfortunately, this order was too small. It was labeled as being W38"" X L32"", which is what I do need, but they felt like these were 36"" waist, which means that I need instead a 40"" waist. This means that I have to return these and I have no way of knowing how to do this. The style of the pants were"
"OR";"Very cute little dresses. My daughter is going to love these when she'll open them up on her birthday in one month. They are well stitched so I am impressed."
"OR";"I give these sheets a full thumbs up! At first I was a little worried because the rpice was so low, but I was pleasantly suprised when they arrived! These sheets are of good quality and the deep pockets fit my mattress and thick matress pad perfectly! The sheets are so soft!"
"OR";"One of the bowls came with an unseemly surface crack. Otherwise nicely made. Wish they sold replacement bowls. Love the stand."
"OR";"My high hopes were not achieved.  My feeling is even the mediocre reviews are overstated.  The movie is simply way to slow.  Virtually no action adventure going on.  I had envisioned something like the Three Kings movie.....not even remotely close."
"OR";"It works as a lift but not as I wanted it for which was to be able to place a dish under it and cook in two dishes at once in my pressure cooker. The legs are no where as long as in the image. Not sure if the product was changed from original images, but the legs are not tall at all.

That said, it "
"OR";"OUR WET BAR FAUCET WAS A MESS. JUST BOUGHT THE HOUSE AND IT STARTED TO FAW APART ! OUR REPLACEMENT IS MORE THAN PERFECT. WE CAN ACTUALLY RINSE GLASSES WITH THE TALL FAUCET."
"OR";"Snug, but that's what a rash guard is supposed to be. I took off a star because this brand doesn't have the stretch of others I've tried, but it might hold up in the water better, too (haven't tried it yet). I'm 5'3"", 130lbs and ordered Small."
"OR";"This was a wonderful story it had me laughing out loud a couple of times the food that was cooked and the way everything was worded made cooking such a sensual treat."
"OR";"There are some phenomenally delicious recipes in this book! We're Instant Pot newbies, and this book got us up and running in no time at all. Highly recommended."
"OR";"Was so disappointed this is so small not worth the money then there was a metal rod in the box I guess to add weight. I will not buy from this seller again it was an embarrassing gift for my daughter"
"OR";"please look good feel great feel real sturdy and supportive and they fit my new rifle yoke perfect"
"OR";"I didn't really care for the movie would not watch again. [ bought because of the reviews. I like true stories. maybe it wasn't my taste"
"OR";"Nice product. Seems pretty strudy and has most Allen keys and sockets for anything you'd need on a typical bike.
Nice and compact as well.
The only thing missing is maybe a valve stem puller, if you have to change a flat.
Recommended."
"OR";"GREAT slipper, runs 1/2 to maybe a full size too long. Not to wide, too long. GREAT leather, soft, comfortable."
"OR";"Fast shipping, thank You!!  It was detached from package, guess it wan't glued right (the plastic).  Product seemed fine so didn't complain."
"OR";"But only at moments. There was also an engaging story- at moments. This story of the events  in a marriage from two different perspectives is unevenly written. You have to be willing to overlook the writing from the opening line; the first but hardly the last incomplete sentence. And Cormac McCarthy"
"OR";"Nice item for the price, but way too small. I ordered 12 month size which will just fit in right to my 5 month old."
"OR";"An essential to anyone's wardrobe.  Absolute classic shoe.  Love my chucks and for a decent price comparatively.  Gotta love Amazon."
"OR";"A kindle single. A true story that is longer than a magazine article, but shorter than a regular book. Four stars for good portrayal of Simon Lewis's life and information about traumatic brain injury and blindsight. It felt like a good magazine article.

Recommended for those who deal with anyone wi"
"OR";"Excellent choice of the early James Bond films: Thunderball, You only Live Twice, and Diamonds are Forever. The action never stops. At no time was I bored."
"OR";"A heartbreaking love story. Bit watch her process her way thru to happy ending! Who does she get in the end? Read it to find out!"
"OR";"It said large on the web site and yet it wouldn't even fit over my 10 week old puppy's head.  misleading information."
"OR";"This shoe is not only beautiful and elegant, but it has a firm structure and feels like a walking shoe. I can wear them all day at work and all evening for a night on the town."
"OR";"i liked this story it was a believable story i only had a few complaints i think she still acted like an adult alot of the time i would of liked it better if she had to give up all control and really lived the lifestyle while in his home.  and i didn't like that she had an affair. sorry for the spoi"
"OR";"Beyond five feet, this thing doesn't work for crap.  Skips, jumps, is inert.  Now I have to go buy another, real mouse."
"OR";"This book looked at life as if it were a business.  The theories are explained in an easy to understand manner that could be helpful to people who are willing to open their minds."
"OR";"This anime was recomended to me and , so I gave it a try and automatically got hooked , its sad and funny with very memorable character . Now and the you remember their dolls that talk and move and your reminded creepy lol . Great anime and great Collection too it includes the OVA as well ."
"OR";"I bought this light several months  ago, it has been in use on a dusk to dawn sensor since then, it has worked exactly as advertised so far. The light color is quite white, at least 5000K but as an outdoor l flood light it has been excellent."
"OR";"I saw this movie when I was a kid, but I never knew it was a book until I found it on Amazon. I just finished reading it to my 4 year old, and we both really enjoyed it. It is well written and exciting, but not too scary. I highly recommend it. It's a short book for adults, but a great length for ch"
"OR";"This book made me so hungry reading it !!!  I can't wait to try out some of the recipes in hear . this book is a must read if you like pizza!!"
"OR";"The hotshot is a light orth waiting for. All my previous lights did not come close in term of brightness or handiness. Just ensure you had charge the light before usage. Another good thing is that hotshot can be charge with a portable power supply and use at the same time."
"OR";"I cried and laughed and fell in love with Raine & Arianna.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes historical romance."
"OR";"I have 4 cats, so I can't afford to splurge on their food.  And sometimes they don't all like one product, and that doesn't work for me.  This kibble is liked by all 4 cats and seems more healthful than some of the less expensive brands.  Good luck pleasing your cats!"
"OR";"Son absolutely loved the costume, wore it 3 days straight before ""officers day off.""  Came with a holster but no toy gun.  Thanks liberals.  Wish they would have replaced it with a walkie talkie or a set of cuffs and just removed the holster."
"OR";"I brought 3 units in 2011.  Just put in for replacement of old timer.  3 of the 3 units I got do not work.  At the end, it just does not turn off."
"OR";"Another great product from OXO.  The pot holder is light and comfortable to use.  It keeps heat away quite well."
"OR";"Awkward in tight locations. Poor grip on larger size lock nuts. Good quality made in USA. I have yet to find a great lock nut wrench. My GB lock nut spanner gets more use."
"OR";"This book kept my interest from beginning to end. The characters interact extremely well together and you almost feel as if you actually know them. This is one of the best books that I have read in a while. It was extremely interesting how all the characters come together in the book. Definitely a g"
"OR";"It doesn't look as refined as the 1/4 version but it does the job. It comes with a blown mold carrying case. The ratcheting mechanism looks a bit too harsh, it feels like you have to give at least a quarter of a turn to get a click (ratchet)."
"OR";"An illogical horror film about a demoniac trapped in a mirror. The only way to destroy it is to let it re-posses a Catholic nun. When the hero does so, he turns into a mirror image of himself. Or something."
"OR";"I found it too bulky and too hard to use for nursing. My son is 7 months old, still nurses, but this bra is in the closet gathering dust."
"OR";"If you can believe it, Spirograph actually works better now than the old version from decades ago when I was a kid. Great price, the kids love it."
"OR";"While these are a little pricey, they are a great way to store all of those million little lego parts from Hero Factory sets.  The added bonus is these huge legos are actually toys themselves because they can be stacked just like the little legos.  Plus, they look great in a playroom!"
"OR";"I like to have bene bac on hand just in case my rabbit needs it. I like this large syringe much better than the little tubes."
"OR";"The genuine article, as promised.  You never know when there are so many knockoffs out there.  This is an item where the cost of the genuine Dell thing wasn't much higher than the cheapo knockoffs.  I always make sure the seller for this sort of thing is Amazon.com."
"OR";"Nice pump with an accurate gauge built in.  Easy to pump and got new bike tube in tire up to 45 lbs in just 4-5 pumps."
"OR";"I've used these tees for several years now, in fact this is my second purchase of these in about two years. They last a long time and do the job."
"OR";"My dog does not mind me using this on her so that is good but the brush removes only a small amount of hair (easy to remove the hair from the brush) compared to a silicone brush which seems to pull out more hair but the hair is on the floor and on the brush.

I am not alternating between both brushe"
"OR";"I have a 2013 2-door Jeep JK and although I cannot open the rear door with this on becuase of the spare tire, I didn't see anything on the market that would allow it anyways.  The build quality of this product is top notch and would recommend."
"OR";"This is a great mat. We have multiple cats and we put this mat in front of our Litter Robot and it has stopped all the litter tracks around the room. We love it."
"OR";"This was the first book I read by Rachel Red. I MUST say that I was very impressed. The book was captivating and kept my attention through the end. I loved  the fact that at the end of the book, all my questions were answered. This book held my interest to the end. I will definitely look for other b"
"OR";"Look forward to reading more of the series books that belong to this serie. Look the whole tale that belong to this series of belong. Very talented author."
"OR";"Works fantastic It jams every now and then but it is very good however you have to be delicate with it because the plastic stick you push ( to let out the bbs ) can break but overall its grate."
"OR";"Great story as usual! Terry Goodkind is one of the best! Once you start reading one of his books you can't put it down!"
"OR";"I always look for a couple of series that can break up the viewing habits.  This is a light hearted English comedy that can relax one and make a smile."
"OR";"I really enjoyed reading this book and can't wait to read the rest of the series. I loved the characters and the story line."
"OR";"Received this book as ARC from NetGalley for review.
Rose Harbor in Bloom (Rose Harbor #2).
The Inn at Rose Harbor (Rose Harbor #1).

"OR";"perfect for holding tools and bolts for your lift or as a belt attachment. Hold a ton of bolts or screws . makes our job a little easier"
"OR";"I've ordered this item before and it worked but....only half the LED's would light. I sent mail to the seller but never heard back..."
"OR";"This light is smaller than I expected, but am truly impressed with how incredibly bright and convenient it is.  This is a must have for any outdoor enthusiast, and Go-Bag.  I am ordering another one!"
"OR";"Loved Axel and Beth's story like all the others in the Wolves of Twin Moon Ranch. Hot and fast with all the characters we have come to know and love. Can really recommend if you like the shapeshifter genre. Free copy received for honest review."
"OR";"I bought these for cats, even though they say dog bow tie. The adjustable strap is too large for even my chubbiest kitty, but I just tied them."
"OR";"11 discs in set only 1 disc played on my high end BD player...  Firmware was up to date; no joy.  Apparently the manufacturing standards for discs AND players have been changed without informing most of the paying customers..."
"OR";"This little book light is great for the price, the light is broad and spreads across both pages and the clip is secure enough not to fall off."
"OR";"3 year old loves that she can change Barbie's clothes.  i love it that she has on boots instead of those tiny shoes that go missing."
"OR";"Why she always threaten to leave and she keeps coming back. You can not want his money,but she kept coming back. She needed to make up her mine and woman up"
"OR";"I liked the show and thought it was rather funny.  Some parts were a little far out, but on a whole it was a fun watch.  I would say WATCH IT."
"OR";"Good quality, fits good, have bought several colors in long sleeve and short. Looking  for short sleeve white."
"OR";"Good little bag. It will hold a helmet, field mask, bat, glove, and balls. It is a little tight fitting the helmet inside."
"OR";"I like having a spoke wrench set of separate tools instead of one of those that has all of the sizes on a single coin-shaped tool. The Avenir set is exactly what I wanted. They're easy to use and provide sufficient leverage to work on very tight or corroded spokes."
"OR";"Charger works well. The headset drops right on or sits on top if the case is closed nd charges reliably. I liked that I could just throw the case (with headset inside it) and off I go. Unfortuntely very unhappy with the headset but loved the case."
"OR";"I've been using this indoor- hung on my door nob to stop the barking.  The machine works fine, but does not seem to bother my dachshund- keeps barking through anything... meanwhile my pitbull seems more affected by it and will cower & go back to bed."
"OR";"cute plates for a birthday party or any occasion. We had extras after my sons' party and the family loved using them when they came over for dinner a few days later!"
"OR";"I ordered my usual size, but will need to return them and get the next larger. I do like the fabric and support they provide as well as the fly."
"OR";"Cleans well. On pieces of jewelry that have stones I just brush solution on with a small paint brush and then rinse. I would suggest using gloves"
"OR";"Instantly hot, the plot draws you in and learn something new in every line. Well written, and very satisfying. Cannot wait for part two."
"OR";"It's like have new doors an 15 year old sheds,Great kit for keeping shed doors close . Should get 15 more yrs"
"OR";"This season Laura Dern continues to amaze with her complete immersion in the main character of Amy.  Her energy and zeal to do what's right no matter the consequences make the viewer squirm, but in the end, also make one feel satisfied."
"OR";"These pillow covers are very durable! The only complaint is that the pillow on the right is much more faded than the pillow on the left. I would much rather they were both the same- either both faded or both bold."
"OR";"This is among the upper tier of custom 10-22 stocks.  Read all of the positive reviews on RimfireCentral.com
Outstand balance for off hand shooting.  Custom bedded from the factory.  Gives you the best accuracy possible.
 It is a great stock!  DW"
"OR";"Great product!! Well balanced and extremely sharp!!! protective carrying cover fits appropriately keeping blade secure."
"OR";"I purchased the green and light blue for the closetmaid cubical organizer for my son's room. This color assortment looks great and the drawers are very nice to have. I use them to hold his socks, extra diaper creams, and other small items that need to be kept in a drawer."
"OR";"Very sturdy surge strip for a solid price. Haven't had my house struck by lightning, so I can't comment on the effectiveness, but I'm trusting $1000 of hardware to it."
"OR";"This is the first book by Ann Leckie I have read, and I really enjoyed it.  It was very engaging from beginning to end - and contains some very intriguing, original, and feasible speculation about possible future technology and social structures. Just what I want out of science fiction. Highly recom"
"OR";"I purchased this thinking it would help my puppy stop pulling on the leash, but the harness rubs under his legs and he is distracted by the leash hanging in front of him. The set looks nice and is well constructed. I'll use the leash, but have no use for the harness."
"OR";"If you love animals, love watching people fall in love, but also discover what it really means to live again after tragedy has struck"
"OR";"The X-L does not even fit over my dogs head - the sizing is extremely small and had to return.
On the positive side, the fabric and quality was beautiful."
"OR";"These socks are very comfortable sock to wear, maybe not as light and thin as drymax, but if you want a sock that has some cushion and comfortable this style are a great choice."
"OR";"Learned a lot about knights, jousting and families. Also how women were treated and how they tried to get equality even in th middle centuries."
"OR";"Absolutely gorgeous.  Have it in my living room to hold our movies and games.  Love the size and the color.  A nice solid piece as well."
"OR";"Love Knipex tool line.  I have many of their products and they are always the first tool I reach for.  Very high quality at a reasonable price."
"OR";"This is beautiful!  The color and feel are great - definitely a true rose gold. Goes on very easy (but taking off is another story lol)."
"OR";"I live in California and earth quakes can be a bit of a problem so having water in a bag is pretty good for an emergency. I keep some in my bug out bag, and in my car. I have never tasted the water inside so I can't say how it tastes, but in an emergency who cares how it tastes?"
"OR";"Fun read.  Miles and Melinda are made for each other.  No cliffhanger!
I can well imagine these two working  it out in the present and dealing
with their pasts at the same time."
"OR";"It's the perfect brightness for around my pool and patio in the evening.  The effect turned out to be even better than I anticipated.  Simple plug in for easy installation."
"OR";"I have a TV on my Kitchen counter with tons of long wires and connectors behind it.  This short HDMI Cable was exactly what I needed to clean up the wired mess."
"OR";"Kind of nutty, with some hilarious paragraphs -- potato socks rolling around, making the author gasp.  Book not as helpful as I hoped it would be."
"OR";"The concept was nice but was very disappointed with the quality of the materials used. It is a fleece like material but is basically threadbare. The cats are basically laying on particle board. Had they used just a little thicker/softer material I would have given this 5 stars. I would not purchase "
"OR";"It fit it's purposes. I needed this textbook for a class, so I bought it. It was filled with a lot of good information I needed for quizzes, lots of interesting information. But at the end of the day, it is a textbook, a necessity for any student taking a class which this book is required. Eh, there"
"OR";"BEST LIGHTING OFT HIS TYPE EVER. VERY BRIGHT BUT EASILY ADJUSTED. GREAT MOVEMENT AND STABLE FOOTPRINT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WOULD BUY AGAIN IF NEEDED. SUPER PRICE. Hope replacement parts are not outrageously expensive and readily available."
"OR";"My 1 year old baby loves it,it is a little bit short as many reviews has said but still interesting"
"OR";"This was a wonderful follow up on the first book, ""Tragic.""
I loved how the art work was described while being painted on
her body. I enjoyed the surprises in this book as well. I really
did not see some of it coming. I wonder what the next book will have
in store? This is still very adult. :) Ready"
"OR";"Works fine, easy to program. Very short range, though that may be a problem with my garage. I have take it off the visor and point it at the garage frequently."
"OR";"Works great.  It's small.  Boots super quick.  I'm using it in the shop since I won't have a heart attack if I break it."
"OR";"This has survived 2 years and many washings and
still looks great.
I will surely buy another, if it ever looks scruffy."
"OR";"I bought these for work, specifically for when I need to be in an area that requires rubber soles.  They are not for all day wear or for wear outside.  These shoes are ideal for my needs."
"OR";"Looks great, protects the tool-kind of a bear to put on but it fits nice and tight.  Def worth it for the expensive tool its protecting."
"OR";"I loved getting Drew and Charity's story. They both made decisions that were hard even at 18 Drew had a good head on his shoulders."
"OR";"I absolutely love the characters of this book.  Desiree made me feel like I literally have known every character all my life."
"OR";"This is an adorable bag. I love the two separate compartments: I can keep one compartment with warm food, and the other with cold food, such as salad and drink."
"OR";"This book was extraordinary, enchanting, enthralling and endlessly entertaining where stubbornness and determination to rise above conflict with a heart of gold and a core of steel to get to where love and happiness lives!

"OR";"This is a very nice set of dishes, and you can store them all in the lunch container. I took it to lunch today and I really like the plates.  Only they are not spill proof really.  Today my bag was soaked and I just cleaned it when I came home.  Ready to go again for another day."
"OR";"awesome product.  works perfectly.  nothing more to say, we now have five of these scattered in the house. i guess the only negative is that they use up one plug."
"OR";"As usual, Hogue products are the best !  Very tight fit, so using a little windex to moisten helps rock it on a lot easier."
"OR";"It's okay, barely. You get what you pay for every time. It's good for a starter 5.1 setup but don't expect any oooos and aahhs.
I purchased the exact item from Walmart for $59.99.
The sound is okay if you use an equalizer to balance things out. Small speakers *always* mean small sound.

"OR";"I have loved all of Sarah Vowell's books, but found this one boring. If I wanted to listen to talk radio, I'd listen to talk radio."
"OR";"Very pleased....I have been using the straw Camelbak for the last 7 years and the last couple I bought broke in some way or another or leaked so I switched to this one and just received it a few days ago and I like it a lot.  Very sturdy, does not leak, keeps water cold"
"OR";"Fantastic way to hide litter boxes. Looks great and easy to assemble. Also easy to clean. Cat approved."
"OR";"Awesome story Sandra did it again.  She always writes the best love stories. I love it .  Deidra  is carrying out her parents wishes to have their ashed in Hawaii.  John is going to spread wife's ashes in Hawaii .  This is where Deidra and John meet.  You will love this story."
"OR";"Great bed. Liked it so much I ordered another one for when she stays with my parents. Well made, ease to clean and my dog loves it. I have a 65 pound yellow lab and she fits on the medium 30 X 42 just perfect with room to roll."
"OR";"Fits as expected, good quality, fast shipping. Thanks again.
To note - it is a light shirt in regards to material, great for summer."
"OR";"As some other reviewers have said, save your money and get just the basic version.  I can see that if you were doing many many drawers of exactly the same size that the deluxe version would come in handy.  But for just a few, the basic tool (which is part of the deluxe package) does the job just fin"
"OR";"Finally resolves the Gamache/Beauvoir relationship. Murder plot is secondary to Surete intrigue.  Nice periods of suspense. I love Henri, the dog!"
"OR";"Right out of the box I couldn't connect, directions were no help as well as tech support.  I sent it back, it's cheaply made and won't withstand much use if I'm doing obstacle races, triatholons etc... I'll wait a few more generations..."
"OR";"very heavy and does keep food warm. it enough room for 4 full size pans not 5, when you need to place sternos in bottom"
"OR";"Always exceed the expectations. So many twist and turns you must pay attention and too often what appears to be that is not the case. Go reread THE BLACKS!!! D CAMILLE did it again!!"
"OR";"Comfortable, have worn for a couple of weeks now. Perfect minimalost shoes. No extra weight, no extra sidewall, durable but thin sole. I am a fan"
"OR";"It's amazing how powerful these few exercises are. Modifications are given for the challenging ones, so anyone can do this. Ravi and Ana make a point of identifying beauty on all levels.

"OR";"One of my kids favorite books. When read well (the more dramatic the better), it's sure to have your little ones rolling with laughter."
"OR";"Grand Son loves it. I have purchased about five different ones from the same seller. All has been great and continue to use the Seller. Fast ship."
"OR";"I got these for my moms Kirby and they fit perfectly. The quality was also good, I had bought some off brand belts and they snapped easily when I vacuumed up my mom and my long hair. With these bands so far so good. It was also cheaper to get these here on amazon than in the local shop."
"OR";"Bowl fell apart on second use. Top ring came completely off. Then second and third rings began to separate. We were traveling and needed the bowl for water and food, very disappointed!!

"OR";"Catlax is a highly effective product for elimination problems in cats.  Much less expensive than other products.  The supplier through Amazon is dependable and prompt."
"OR";"First item received was disfunctional. I was able to get a replacement keeping the old battery for the other remote and expedited shipping for free
This will work but if you have a case over your lens it will not.

"OR";"Was hoping for a spin-off from Club Sin! Easy read, emotion packed! Looking forward to the next book in this new series"
"OR";"The design is convenient for plugging in dc adapters (bricks).  The cord to the wall outlet is long and rotates at the surge protector.
I'll hopefully never find out how well it functions as a surge protector, but at least the specs are good."
"OR";"They stay on and keep feet warm. Their size seems to run a little small, though. Somewhat pricy but good to have a pair."
"OR";"Southern Africa is such a complex place but this story gives a good outline to life post-apartheid for Africans and white descendants. It was certainly very nostalgic for me."
"OR";"The earrings came on time and as advertised. I bought them to go with a necklace and gave both necklace and earrings as a gift. I was more or less satisfied with the match between the earrings and necklace."
"OR";"Really good read.  You get to understand, that most of the people in DC are really just a microcosm of the rest of us, and that should really scare us."
"OR";"I must say I truly enjoyed this book. It is definitely a must read. It kept my attention. I would recommend this book to others."
"OR";"If it weren't for the long time it takes to fill and the horrible aroma of chlorine bleach I would give them 5 stars instead of 4."
"OR";"FEELS fabulous. Down marks for the metal case making the key clicks resonate and ring too much, and that the 10-key pad is IBM standard (with double size plus key) and NOT Mac standard, which is crucial for working in ProTools."
"OR";"It has hooks on one surface like in Velcro, that was a surprise. Pretty sure it performed better than the other brand that has green & yellow sponge on magnets."
"OR";"This is simply one of the best rock n' roll biographies I've ever read.  It reads like a novel, not the usual dry biographical documentary.  If you like U2, or if you just want to read a really good book with interesting characters, this is the book for you!"
"OR";"Lathers up really well, so a little goes a long way. Leaves our hair (dogs and human) clean and shiny. From the label:
""Made in USA

Ingredients: Coconut shampoo base, aloe vera gel, essence of lavender, essence of mint, chamomile extract, sage extract, nettle extract, rosemary extract, wheat protei"
"OR";"I was expecting a children's film, but it was not. I rented it because I thought it was one of those classic animated films and it is indeed. Not only it's a classic, but it gave me nightmares and it's a good thing though. More animated films should be made like this, but with originality without su"
"OR";"Light, easy to inflate, and is actually very comfortable. at less than half the price of some of the more expensive brands it is definitely just as high in quality if not better"
"OR";"I use it every day to go to work sometimes I forget that I am wearing it. I am very happy with it will need to purchase another one soon."
"OR";"Great to have mini file sets, for plastic modeling. Comes with 3 mini file sets. Flat, round, and triangular shaped files. Does a decent job at filing down rough edges or creating even holes."
"OR";"I loved all the other bookes that was written about this family, I love all Tim LaHaye's novels. They are all so good and they are teaching even they are fiction they are based on the truth."
"OR";"Great for wearing with jeans. It fit true to size. It is very comfortable. I have a wide foot so I always worry about fit. This shoe is great."
"OR";"Great looking compact knife that gives you full access the the cutting power of the razor blade.  Slice through cardboard like a hot knife through butter.  Reverse the blade when the first side becomes dull and you are ready to go again."
"OR";"Arrived very fast with most ants alive. About 2-3 were dead upon arrival. But otherwise they are functioning well, digging their tunnels and quite interesting to watch."
"OR";"tested in my back yard vs 20-30mph winds, held up fine was not damaged.  color is ugly.  all their colors were ugly but at least its cheap and functional."
"OR";"I am FAR from a jewelry expert by any stretch, and as a guy in particular, I freely admit I rarely notice earrings unless they are over-sized, or a womans hair is pulled up sufficiently so they can be noticed...however, I was quite impressed with the quality LOOK of these earrings. I gave them to my"
"OR";"I used it once and the foot strap already broke, I am really disappointed, I am a personal trainer and I was recommending it for my customer, so it's a shame the quality is really bad"
"OR";"Great low price for a nice bandolier. The shells fit very tight when installed in the sleeves. I don't feel like they'll fall out when I'm in the woods or at the range. I'm able to store different gauge buckshots and slugs on the same bandolier."
"OR";"She is a HUGE fan of Wubzy. This toy isn't as much fun as the dancing wubzy with the clown hair tho. She plays with that one ALL the time."
"OR";"Used this on a Ruger LC9.  After trimming it to fit for length , I heated it and installed it.  It takes some effort to slip it on, but it fit nicely and is exactly what I was hoping for."
"OR";"Easy instructions - love that they are right on the bar! I've ordered 2 now and they are simple and easy to use and look very nice."
"OR";"This was going to be one of our ""theme park"" backpacks! It survived one trip, did not survive the the next day. We did not pack anything heavy. the heaviest items were 3, 8 0z water bottles. Very disappointed. I guess I got what I paid for."
"OR";"Find are great. Snorkel is good mask is ok. Mask leaks and snorkel not really positioned well and easily takes on water."
"OR";"This motor is typical of the quality products made by LEGO.  It is easy to make your creations movable with this motor (you also need the battery box) and will make them more interesting as they come alive with movement.  It is well made and it should survive many years of abuse!"
"OR";"I bought this for the price. My instructor wants the newer version. But I have been using this, so far so good. only thing is the papers are different than the new one."
"OR";"With this, I can really get good distance on our fetch game. My dog is pretty fit and throwing short distances gets tiring for my arm because the dog brings the ball back so quickly. This gives my arm a break and the dog a longer run."
"OR";"Cheap material that falls apart. but hey what do you expect for $3 socks coming from China. Not happy. Also you can't tell what design is on them."
"OR";"It is a beautiful Bible. It's lightweight and easy to carry. I love the illustrations and the wide margins for journaling and note taking. I highly recommend this Bible."
"OR";"Product description  incorrectly states as wireless. What they meant was one wire less. Unit did indeed need (1) traveler,  ground  and neutral wires. Itonly saves one less wire than normal. but that is not wireless...."
"OR";"This little outfit is beautiful!  Fits my grand daughter's  My Life doll perfect!  Will definitely order more Emily Rose Doll clothes!"
"OR";"I was so happy to get this. I have a shower that is 80ish inches wide. It makes it so much easier when bathing my daughter. Now she can be sitting anywhere in the shower and it can reach her."
"OR";"Star trek is one of movies that I like to see. I enjoy Sci-fi movies more then other kind of movies. I will watch others anyway."
"OR";"Once again, Karen Kingsbury delivers a fabulous story in fiction; however these stories are also very realistic. God works amazingly through Karen Kingsbury."
"OR";"My Aussie loves crates, and especially this one. It is well made, large, and easy to clean. He has the best room in the house!"
"OR";"Worked great for a puppy birthday party. Surprisingly they held up and even stayed on some of the dogs as they ran around the dog park."
"OR";"My two year old grandson was thrilled when this arrived.  He has enjoyed playing with it. I love that while he knows the movie, he puts his own creative play on it"
"OR";"I have only used it twice so far but it is super easy and makes incredibly tasty yogurt. I have only used the organic store bought plain for a starter but it has been good. Easy set up, clean up and saves a ton on those little 5oz cartons that we were eating up so quickly."
"OR";"Really good, comes with extension cord, and sticker. Packaging designed by fort knoxx, but looks nice. Sounds great, and looks good too. The microphone sounds okay, but I would recommend buying a snowball for any really intensive need for quality."
"OR";"The back can NOT be easily removed like literally any other picture frame on the planet. Be prepared to work and I hope you want to keep those pictures in there for awhile."
"OR";"Only five minutes into this play and I had to turn it off.  I can't stand how Tyler keeps putting the ratchet, ghetto scenes in his plays.  There is no need for over-acting."
"OR";"Accidentally broke a previous set that I loved so I had to buy another. This refurbished set works just as well. My only issue is that the retraction button doesn't work as well as my previous set. It's a little annoying that I have to press it so hard and now it's really slow. Other than that a gre"
"OR";"Hi all,

This is a good item. It does what it is supposed to do. I use it for working out sessions and it has multiple options for beeping and vibrating. It works quite well."
"OR";"i love them  but have not had time to do any thing with them.
also i love the crystal that you sent as a free gift.
i glue it to a piece of tile that i had pickup at a construction site.
it look good with my collection.

"OR";"Eli's and Rachel's story continues in part 2 and its as good as the part 1.  This series will blow you away.  Big BRAVO! from this gal."
"OR";"Fox is a reliable name. These are well designed, strap system works great. has padding where you need it and ventilation where you need it. well thought out design.
these are as good as 661 knee and shin guards (hardshell) .
highly recommend for mountain biking."
"OR";"This is my second purchase of the Infinity Kappa 693.91 3-way, 6 x 9 co-as speakers. They are great sounding in both cars (Corvette/Van) and can handle a lot of volume.  I would highly recommend them and would purchase them a 3rd time if needed."
"OR";"I don't give out five stars often, but this movie merits 5 at least.
My degree in history came in handy for this film.  With attention to detail, the film is not only breathtaking in scope, scenery, and impact, it is a living history wherein you can see a slice of 18th century life.
The film is anot"
"OR";"Why pay the electric company to scramble a few eggs or blend up a protein shake? Pocket the difference and you'll live better in the long run.  Please take in to account that the average mixer has a short lifespan and is a recycling nightmare, also.  Lose a beater for your electric mixer?  It's goin"
"OR";"I was pondered the mystery of the voices from movie previews-parts of this are hilarious, I want to do voice over work and can relate - I didn't give 5 stars though because some parts drag and some are predictable and cheesy but overall I liked it and I'd you like mockuments and movies you should en"
"OR";"Anybody who knows Hogue grips knows this is an excellent add-on for most semi-autos.  It's (intentionally) fairly difficult to install because it wouldn't stay on otherwise.

Shipper was very good.  They accidentally shipped the wrong color and corrected the problem easily by phone."
"OR";"This is an exceptional detailed fixture. Looks expensive. the only time consuming thing is putting on all the crystal pieces.
A touch of old world charm."
"OR";"It was good to see the return of SPECTRE, but any reader will be able to pick up on the plot twist because it's so predictable.  Also their is a lot of technical gibberish in this novel."
"OR";"Seemed to be ok as far as a tablet computer goes. If the sound output was better, it would be a much better tablet. You really need powered speakers or headphones to get good sound. It amazes me that Asus has not corrected this problem on other models."
"OR";"I truly enjoyed this sequel.  Didn't think it would end so soon.  I want Xavier to have kids.  What happened to the other sisters.  I need to know"
"OR";"Excellent system, now they are coming out with 4K for video, always something to make you spend more money.  But I really like the system and it is capable for 3D."
"OR";"A realtor and her lawyer have been friends since seventh grade and he has had a crush on her since high school.  They finally get together as more than friends and the sparks fly."
"OR";"Great quality, very well done.  My only complaint, shoes came off my heels. Do not know if my heels are narrow or shoe was made too wide."
"OR";"Connections are light duty and can break as mine did. It should come with a power supply as the connector is metric and was a little difficult to find a mate that fit."
"OR";"This is a great heater for bedrooms or other small to medium rooms.  Shuts off when it reaches the desired temp.  The listed temp may not be exact, but you can adjust to your comfort."
"OR";"these shoes are super comfortable.  I have purchased 3 pairs of these in the last year or so....problem is that they just don't hold up for a longer period of time.  Even the laces show signs of wear after only a few weeks.

the comfort and price make up for these small shortcomings.  Will purchase "
"OR";"Fantastic Kaiju from NECA! Tons of articulation, great paint ops and includes a small stand to get this guy into a perfect movie-accurate pose.

If only NECA would release a new (bigger) Leatherback figure, I would be truly happy."
"OR";"After buying shower heads with many adjustments and options; I finally wised up.  This is a simple but good shower head that puts out a good spray."
"OR";"PERFECT for my 20 yr old to take a good lunch to work. Makes me happy to know he's eating well on his own"
"OR";"These stories are very well written. I can't wait to read the NEXT one. I just don't know who is next to fall in love!!!"
"OR";"Not the best movie we've ever seen. Wish I wouldn't have purchased it and instead rented it. It's a one time watch of a movie."
"OR";"The product arrived as described in a timely manner. I have not had the opportunity to use this and hope I never will since it is for emergency situations. This is a great addition to my personal emergency kit I keep in the car and I added one to my scout`s 10 essentials kit."
"OR";"My four month old son loves playing with his piano mat. I highly recommend this gym to anyone with a young infant."
"OR";"Great learning puzzle. My 3 and a half year old loves it. Still needs assistance but does pretty good by himself too."
"OR";"Very Very fantastic camera. Have other full size sensor SLR's and this easily holds its own. The Leica summicron lens with nano coating and digital filter is second to none. Can you say Value? Knew you could. A++++
Really wide angle as well."
"OR";"Love Miss Julia! These books on cd are lighthearted and fun. I drive a lot for work, so they really help pass the time."
"OR";"Awesome sleeves if you double sleeve them with the KMC Perfect Size pochettes!, they're still going strong, very little resistance when shufflling!"
"OR";"This was a great investment. Kept all salads cold during the day and did not take up alot of room like using a baby pool would."
"OR";"We bought this for our game room! It looks great and even our 4 year old can get in on the fun! Very happy with purchase."
"OR";"Very nice sheets.  They wrinkle but I have no problem with my sheets being wrinkled.  Nice and cool in the summer.  Fit was very good ... almost oversized for my regular mattress."
"OR";"Had to have this color for work, and they were much cheaper here than at the uniform shop. THey fit just like I would expect. Very durable. Color match is perfect."
"OR";"Never thought I would own one of these. Works fantastic and is easy to install. Needed it for a door that leads to my outdoor deck. My Newfie can  go in and out without a problem. One year old and is still in fantastic shape considering I do not have a covered deck."
"OR";"This is the best pancake holster I have ever purchased. The leather was already broken in and soft, the gun fit perfectly and it looks great."
"OR";"These are really cute, a bit small but since you can adjust the string it's ok. It comes with extra pom poms which is really nice"
"OR";"I will not review this intermittently compelling, but overlong book except to say that it is absolutely the worst place to start reading the Wallender books. Please do NOT read this book unless you have already read several other books in the series and plan to follow the entire arc."
"OR";"Ok so the trickiest step was step one.
the hardest step was step four
the most annoying step was assembling the drawers.

They said you would need two people to assemble it but i did it by myself. Let me tell you something, if you are stubborn enough or skilled enough or have the right tools you can"
"OR";"This is a really good brush. I like the way it retracts and the hair just wipes off of it. I have a Golden Retriever that sheds a lot. It works great."
"OR";"Installed these on my outdoor lighting transformers. They do NOT have a memory of the setting if power is lost but this is a compact and well designed unit so it gets 5 stars."
"OR";"I know this is a popular book but it was not right for me. I tried reading this for my book club. I started from the beginning 3 times and could not get into it. Then I skipped ahead about 50 pages to see if it would catch my interest.  It never did.  I am glad I saw the movie but this book was not "
"OR";"The doggies look forward to these treats, crunchy and healthy. But i am not convinced they really make the dogs relax or calmer, but they are yummy (according to the furries)!"
"OR";"Thank you Amazon Rep for resending this to my niece for Christmas.  She got her gift and is very happy with her product. Plus that she got in was a big plus for me and for her for most. Thank you."
"OR";"Pro: Very pretty! Perfect to take out off town or somewhere you are scared to take your real wedding ring!

Con: Haven't found one."
"OR";"This scarf was so cute in person, so happy I bought it not to mention the price is great! Super fast shipping and would no doubt buy again!"
"OR";"These saved my fingers for sure. Very easy to use and was able to load quickly. Came in very handy when I loaded my four new magazines which were tight."
"OR";"Great read. Kept move at a very good pace. It was very easy to visualize the canyon walls as they climbed. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to go and visit Texas's high desert. Keep writing books of the caliber and I will keep reading them."
"OR";"rapido y seguro el servicio me gusto el producto porque era justo lo que vi es justo lo que me llego"
"OR";"Wish they were a bit cheaper but otherwise these are the real deal! Hope they stay good till the zombie apocalypse! We will be getting more as the budget allows!"
"OR";"My coonhound loves it. She usually murders her toys within 5 minutes but this has lasted for a while. Of course, she takes out the squeaky part quick but the crinkle."
"OR";"Who cares what I think? Our cat LOVES this stuff! So much so it's hard to believe it's just freeze-dried chicken. But apparently it is. Now our cat comes running whenever he hears the rustling of a plastic bag. Not sure if that's a good thing, but the cat seems happy : )"
"OR";"I've tried several nursing bras and they all are too small or uncomfortable. This one was the best I tried so I went back and bought another."
"OR";"This bra was just what I was looking for! I wanted a bra with straps that don't slip off my shoulders. This bra design will prevent this I think, and that will be great. Also, it fits well and I like the easy front closure, so I ordered another one. I highly recommend this bra."
"OR";"I loved the story and even tho it bogged down a bit in the middle I enjoyed it and wanted to keep reading the next story."
"OR";"I use this basket on my knee scooter and now my walker and its been a lifesaver. It holds a lot of stuff, nice size, durable.  I added a cup holder on it too."
"OR";"This was an incredibly sweet story a little too short if you ask me but still sweet. I love Devyn and Joseph chemistry and the lack of drama in their relationship. I enjoyed the Reese and Jay cameos their relationship is progressing nicely. This was another CCJ success."
"OR";"It's a slow burn, but once it heats up this book is hard to put down. Gone Girl gives married couples something to think about and might just scare singles from getting married. It raises the question of who we are when we're with the one we love. Are we really ourselves or are we the person they wa"
"OR";"Its a nice length, and feels really durable.  It seems to charge about as fast as the OEM cable.  And I like the blue color, its different."
"OR";"Wonderful spice rack, fits right against the wall on my counter or put on the wall.  I find it holds good sized spice jars easily and I'm going to get another so I can put my other spices out where they'll be within reach."
"OR";"Cable did not work. Arrived dead. Tried it on two different laptops and two different monitors. Can't exchange can only get refund."
"OR";"Safely holds my Target-branded 2 burner stove plus a Coghlan griddle inside the main compartment.  No banging around so nice protection."
"OR";"The workmanship of this garment seems fine, and if it fit right, I'd be pretty excited about it. I figured it'd be a little loose but the size was on ultra-sale, so I decided to try it. Turns out their plus sizes are REALLY plus-sized.

It's very pretty, and I wish it fit right."
"OR";"Ordered this after we realized someone was ""chatting"" with my daughter via a cell phone game (!)
Trying to explain the threat and the reality of this was complicated.  This DVD did the trick."
"OR";"give this a foo rating I thik somene said yay I love my little ppony these figures are great for kids and adults"
"OR";"Great shoe, super cute.  Runs bigger than traditional athletic shoes so I had to return them.  Doesn't come in smaller sizes."
"OR";"Without dropping big bucks for authentic, this replica fits the bill. The colors are authentic. It fits perfectly. Quality material and excellent craftsmanship. All seems are flawless and there are no loose threads. High quality product with an even better price."
"OR";"Excellence should be rewarded
by the accolades of the masses
to repudiate the lack luster
fortunes of todays mediocrity and
to add to the plethora of applause
reuired to extend a glad hand."
"OR";"The book is for an Art History class I am taking for self-improvement.
It is in great 'used' condition; I did not want to pay the price for a new one.
Thanks, amazon, for making it available to me.
The art work in this book is what I will be seeing when I go to Paris & London next month!"
"OR";"Small and very sturdy piece of hardware.  This device is the unmanaged.  This is all I needed for my last port available on my router.  Once the switch was hooked up I wired the 65"" smart TV and the Blue Ray so that we could view movies on Vudu.  Simple setup."
"OR";"My dog loves to chase things so a ball is a great toy for her. She is at the intense chewing phase so she likes that she can grab and chew this toy. She is around 3lbsz Kinda a flimsy so am not sure how much it will last when she grows up a little more. Do not recomend for bigger breads."
"OR";"I was concerned my oven temperature was off but using the Winco Dial Thermometer assured me the temperature was correct.  I like the hook which made it easy to use."
"OR";"My 3 year old Granddaughter love these.  It was great to have additional PDF files that could be printed out
again and again.  Just keep in mind the colors are not stated to be washable.  My granddaughter was so
proud that she could take the lids off by herself.  She pushed down to hard but still tu"
"OR";"Quick read full of easily obtainable goals. By following the seven steps listed in this book you are certainly setting yourself up for success and happiness."
"OR";"Book 2 in this fantastic series..it's just great. Love this one as much as the first one. Can't wait to continue on!"
"OR";"One of my favorites of Mr Coopers.  The Daniel Briggs series is great and I look forward to additional books in the series.  The writing and story lines are interesting.  I find I can't put the book down until I have finished it.  All his books are good reading.  You won't be disappointed."
"OR";"I both loved and hated this book.  I guess that is what makes it a classic.  The character development is great, you feel like you know these people.  I really don't know why the book is named Anna Karenia because I really wanted to keep getting to the parts about Kitty and Levin."
"OR";"My wife loves it and uses it lot on our induction cooking range where iron content is required.  The pan is heavy but the opposing handle is very helpful."
"OR";"This is a good temp pen, but my dog easily knocks it over to escape... Even when he was recovering from a surgery. He would break free to run to the door of the door bell rang. Those plastic children's colorful play pens served me better."
"OR";"I would like to have back the hours wasted reading this book. Totally unlike any Koontz book I have ever read."
"OR";"Stories within a story, twists in each tale, lovely characters. Although it got a bit confusing initially, it's worth reading."
"OR";"LOVE this! Looks even better than the picture, true fit. I received this item free/discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"OR";"Went from several years of Dish network toy to DirecTv and never looked back. We placed the RF boxes downstairs and change the channels from the piggy backed tv's with these controllers. They work great with the home distribution system from Amazon."
"OR";"One of the most powerful movies I have seen a long while! Will Smith and Jaden are an incredible duo with a powerful and intense story. For anyone who has gone through hardship in their life, I totally recommend this movie for inspiration. Mind over matter. You want something go out and get it!"
"OR";"The pieces are the perfect size for my granddaughters and are easy to clean.  We've had quite a few tea parties over the past 2 days! They love it..."
"OR";"The Pointehaven  heavyweight flannel sheet set is so pretty and soft and cuddly. Matched with the snowflake blanket it makes a wonderful gift or enjoy it yourself."
"OR";"Seems a bit small for a 7 1/2, so looked pretty dorky on a grown man's head. But I gave it to my son, who is 11, and it fit him perfectly and looks great on him! Fabric is a bit thin, but I know he'll get good use of it out in the sun!"
"OR";"Its the perfect size for 2-5 yr olds.  It has cute sayings from the show, and my son has taken to holding and playing with it while he watches the show."
"OR";"Esta historia te hace soar, en ella encontrars todo tipo de sentimientos para poder encontrar el amor, es muy buena la recomiendo."
"OR";"I enjoy this author immensely.  The stories are great and enjoyable. I like how incorporates people coming to Christ and demonstration for the need of prayer."
"OR";"Well written story. We were a little surprised by how long the chapters were (we thought it was an early reader), but once we recalibrated we enjoyed the story very much."
"OR";"There's so much more to Agora. Kingdoms in conflict, the future of the children and the hopes of parents, all set to the deepening of the characters we already fell in love with. Can't wait to read the next one. My only fear is I'll read them all and have to wait for the next to be published."
"OR";"Story about a gradual financial collapse and a man who helps his sibling and her husband prepare, as well as giving sound advice to the town powers that be."
"OR";"My laptop does not have card reader and I need something like this one. I bought one, which was falling in pieces. This one is virtually indestructible."
"OR";"I put this food down for my cats and they all ran over to the food dish!  The cat food looked good and smelled good and my cats just loved it!  The food came in an easy to open package that was not a hassle to open.  I wouldn't have a problem ordering this food regularly."
"OR";"Cats seemed to enjoy this and no hairballs or hacking like before.  Cheaper here than in the store but was informed no longer available so I switched to Purina One for my kitties."
"OR";"They may not be picture perfect machine-finished but the metal is good they hold up and do their job and were much better than I expected for the amazingly low price."
"OR";"Brilliant product! The ONLY thing that my weimaraner could not chew off in seconds. Easy as heck to wrap too. Don't even bother with anything else."
"OR";"ive used lots of brands and thus one dose such a good job. clumps hard and keeps the odors away."
"OR";"Bought for our tuft and needle king size mattress. We upgraded from a queen. This platform barely takes away space. So far no squeaks. Love the height, it's perfect for getting in and out of the bed. Also makes it easy to store things under the bed."
"OR";"perfect fit.  replaced the front door speakers in 2003 chevy and was back in business in 10 minutes.  range and volume were just as expected."
"OR";"Worked with no problems to replace the DVD burner in my Windows PC that had gone belly up. I wish it had been available with a white faceplate to match the PC case, but no big deal (in the old days, almost all drives were only available with black faceplates, so I have been here before)."
"OR";"We use these in AV equipment racks. Drill out the little indents on the flanges for mounting them. Big-box store variety gave us trouble, but not these."
"OR";"Cute, hilarious light reading in the Mule Hollow Series.  The matchmakers strike again....or not.  The bachlorette is so hard to please and uppity that no one will ask her out....except for one particular bachelor that she believes is a good for nothing, only to be proved quite wrong."
"OR";"Excellent movie showcasing Bette Davis .  The DVD copy was a clear reproduction and arrived with lightening speed! I highly recommend this vendor."
"OR";"Or lady of Guadalupe is part of my heritage so I wanted to have it. I really like the look of 3D pretty colors make it stand out, and flowers"
"OR";"This was a solid movie, I would definitely recommend seeing it.  This was not one of those movies you are glad that you did not pay to see it in the theater.  It is a must see."
"OR";"Love! Love! Love! Mrs. McClain, you are one of the greatest. If you like shifter/vampire books, you will love this series."
"OR";"What a funny gift! Got this for a friend for Christmas, and he said, ""I don't do nuts,"" to which I replied, ""Neither does she!""  But regardless of where you stand on politics, you have to admit this is a riot. I had hoped to get the Bill corkscrew, but that was twice the price. AND these are collect"
"OR";"A very enjoyable book - pleasure to read - must go back and reread the first one in the series.  Too early in the morning to be wordy."
"OR";"Love this bar wrap verses 6 or so others I've tried.  Also, long enough to fully wrap my Zipp speedbars."
"OR";"Finally after years of fighting algae we have a clear pond! It took a couple weeks but it has been perfect since then; we couldn't be happier. We have tried so many different things to clear up our pond and if I had known how well this worked we would have bought it years ago."
"OR";"Installed this memory into a mid-2010 MacBook Pro. Cheap price and quick installation gave my MacBook Pro new life in five minutes."
"OR";"Absolutely love this knife. Its heavy duty. The blade holds a ridiculous edge and the handle grip is outstanding. The assisted open is just gravy."
"OR";"Loved it when I was a kid, bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Maybe I'll be able to watch it with my great-granddaughter in 20 years.  I'll only be 80!"
"OR";"I've not read a Bobbi Romans book that I didn't love. She hits the ground running on the first page, and it gts more exciting every paragraph. Her writing is steamy sexy, so not for my younger friends, but those of you who can stand some sex scenes, good stuff!"
"OR";"I liked it and wanted to read the ending.  But...just too goody two shoes.  Everything worked out too well.  I loved the concept but things just fell into her lap.  Sorry - real life is not like that.  And that is the problem.  I was not pulled enough into this book to suspend my critical mind."
"OR";"My husband liked it, but I was bored. It didn't really hold my interest. I also felt like the ending could have been wrapped up better."
"OR";"Nothing like i expected to say the least. Its super thin material and very cheap looking overpriced costume. I bought this for my nephew and he seems to like it, after hallooween im dumping it. If they sold it cheaper i could have said ok it was worth it but its rubbish."
"OR";"My kitties go CRAZY for this stuff.  Don't know why Fancy Feast is so different from any other canned cat food but if you want a treat for your sweeties, this is it."
"OR";"these are awesome, dogs love them and the size is not to small not to big. The perfect size treat for any size dog. Which makes them very economical."
"OR";"This is a great puzzle holder for the thinner M&D puzzles but does not work as well for the chunky puzzles.  You can still get them in but they take up two slots due to their height.  I wish M&D would make a universal puzzle rack for ALL their puzzles."
"OR";"Great swings, but they did not come with quick clips to attach to swing set.  Make sure you order/purchase those too or you may have some disappointed kiddos at the playset!"
"OR";"Steven Hawking is perhaps one of the most misguided pseudo philosophers in the world.....I wish he would stick to physics and leave philosophy to those who understand it."
"OR";"A book I always heard about in high school but never read. I'm glad I read it and would suggest this book to others."
"OR";"Nice clock. Love that it is two sided. Keeps time well. Nice size. Looks nostalgic enough."
"OR";"All in all, it's a decent blade, gets the job done - cuts aluminum. It came nicely packaged in thick cardboard ""sleeve"", with clear tubing protecting the teeth. 5 stars for packaging.
At my place, it will be used now and then for thin aluminum angle and strips.
Cuts are not clean, I have to use a fi"
"OR";"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, a"
"OR";"This was another one of Stuart Woods' Stone Barrington novels that once I reached the half way point I could not put down.  It was easy to picture the action in my mind as I read each chapter, particularly the last half of the book.  It really came alive."
"OR";"I refuse to do hip thrust without this. It beats the yoga mat rolling or mat adjustment. Very nice for squats. I hate the Velcro pad that's pull my hair. If you like to focus on flutes and legs with a barbell this is a must!!!"
"OR";"Es justamente lo que esperaba, buen producto, llego sin problemas estoy contento, me gusta y prodra recomendarlos sin ningn problema. satisfecho con la compra"
"OR";"I love this scale its easy to use I need two! If I would have known that Bed Bath and Beyond also carried this brand I could have saved myself the shipping cost. There are several YouTube videos that will also help answer any questions you may have."
"OR";"I bought these as a replacement for an older pair of Sony earbuds. I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very"
"OR";"I like the series. I liked being pulled into a show and forget about the world.  Watch fantasy a bit and its pretty cool.  Story was fun."
"OR";"Great strips, replaces the hook strips.
If removed properly, the adhesive will NOT remove any paint or vinyl at all.

Please be sure you remove it by pulling up or down, and not by just pulling it off."
"OR";"This is poorly made and poorly designed. The hose attachment was impossible to secure and the donut hole with the blue plastic curtain looked like an uncomfortable fit for my 2 and 4 yr old grand kids. It was returned as defective."
"OR";"I like the ergonomic curves of the ""tractor"" style seat. The chair is light, and not heavy duty, but it's comfortable enough and rolls around nicely."
"OR";"Excellent ... as advertised.  Heavy, holds my specialized in place.  Felted bottom makes it nice for parking my bike on the tile in the dining room."
"OR";"Nice way for my daughter to practice applying makeup. Make goes on paper pretty good, better than I thought. She enjoys it."
"OR";"Junk.. way too small. I ordered two other sweaters same size from different vendors and the other two fit perfectly.. this one was horrible"
"OR";"Another grand slam. Convoluted, complex and difficult to foresee, Child's plot surprises and satisfy's again. Reacher notches another solved case."
"OR";"Can't wait for the third book to come out. Wished it came out sooner. Will want to read the first 2 again before I read the third."
"OR";"this book was a very good read. I had never read anything by Ms. Sawyer but I will again, would love to read the next in this series"
"OR";"Excellent read!!  The characters are deep and make you feel invited into their world.  I can't wait to read more Blossom Street novels!"
"OR";"The only word that discribes this is perfect ! I turn it on and it connects to my phone without difficulty ! My voice is very clear to the person on the other end of the phone ! I love my new hands free device , makes my driving and talking safer ! Get it for someone you love, just as my husband did"
"OR";"Funny gag apron and it turns the girls heads for sure, made a little cheaply and runs small, but it's worth it.  Can't complain, it's the only time I could get my wang touched by women without my wife getting upset!  lol"
"OR";"Very cute will buy again I liked how they shipped fast and they are delicate with the clothes nice soft material good company I will recommend buying from them."
"OR";"Very nice little hobby drill press.  Very useful high speed range too, allowing you to use it for shaping items mounted on a mandrel."
"OR";"Got them yesterday, Hung them this morning and set them for motion detection and when the sun went down they worked perfectly. Nice dim light on all the time and bright light when motion is detected.  Simple install and great product. If they last I'll be thrilled!"
"OR";"Placed the old laptop drive (with some bad sectors) in this housing and recovered most of my data. Inexpensive, but has a solid case. Would definitely recommend."
"OR";"Very comfortable sandal with a higher arch for support.  Ordered a size 6 (my shoe size) and these fit perfectly heel to toe. Easy to walk in without the shoes slipping off...no sloppy feel to them.  Love the Burnt Henna color!!"
"OR";"Dont even know its there very quite.  looks good on my desk and no problems so far. Thank you Western. Easy to install also."
"OR";"My dog loves these, but likes peanut butter flavor better.  So he asked me to remove one star.  Otherwise, two paws up!"
"OR";"I can't say too much as the 1st. book was free.  However, I certainly am not going to pay $2.99 each for the balance of the story since each book is only minimal pages!  The Author should have held off and published as one complete book!  I won't be looking into anymore of his books."
"OR";"Another wonderful epic Wally Lamb novel. You always know going into a Lamb novel that it won't be short, but you also will not be disappointed. We Are Water dares you to find a stopping point and put the book down. It'll be a challenge, I promise."
"OR";"Enjoyed the twists and turns in the plot very well written kept me in suspense up to the end highly recommend especially FibOnacci fans"
"OR";"Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesn't make you sweat. It's a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey."
"OR";"I have read this series a number of times. Glad to see more and more of them coming into Kindle format.  Great reads, incredible character development."
"OR";"Serves it's purpose but we actually took the plastic piece off that covers the lens because my daughter felt like it was making her pictures more blurry and unclear. The only reason she wanted it was for the selfie mirror anyway to make sure that she would be getting her face in the picture."
"OR";"Works great.  Used it to make metal ABC roof panels to fit, no issues.  Fit my Rigid drill with no problems"
"OR";"My 10 & 8 years olds love to play board and card games.  Which really frustrates my 4 year old b/c most games are too complex for him.  This is a great game that you can involve a preschool/kindergartener yet your 4th/5th grader will still enjoy."
"OR";"Honestly, I don't love it but my boys do.  lol  A fun game that kids seem to get a kick out of.  If you are looking for something different, this is a good pick although I personally wouldn't buy it for younger than teen, tween at the youngest.  But I'm old-fashioned."
"OR";"Holding up great!  After two years of hard use it is still going strong.  Have carried upwards of 75 pounds on it with no concerns."
"OR";"My dog hates it... it's too big to fit into the back of his mouth to get to his rear molars. He takes off running every time he sees it."
"OR";"However, the characters knew each other and I'm not sure from what series.

The character development was still very good  with auxiliary characters not ignored either."
"OR";"This little book is laugh-out-loud entertaining. If you don't already ""know"" the persons in the pseudo-interviews, you'll want to Google them to get the humor."
"OR";"Cooks pasta just fine. Could do the same with any bowl! What I didn't like was there is a 1/2"" ridge in the bottom and the pasta sticks in there bad and hard to get out!"
"OR";"The best science fiction series ever written. I recommend this series to all devoted fans. Excellent story and well written."
"OR";"Jewel was pretty, story stunk, other acting was so so...... Another good ""switch brain off and watch"" movie! Long Live Jewel!"
"OR";"Our local shelter for families in crisis is providing these to their clients along with a study of it while they are there.  This is so that once they are out of a dangerous situation, they don't go back to it.  Very important skills - life-saving!"
"OR";"While not Feist's best writing, it wasn't his worst either. Feist may not be the most eloquent writer on earth, but in my opinion, he is one of the most intriguing. Prince Arutha and his brothers are heros, and while I wish Feist had written more books about Arutha's exploits, I enjoyed reading abou"
"OR";"All this is about is sex.  Nothing to review. Can't say anything about the author or the content of this book as it is just  crud.
This is not recommended unless you are into a book about sex."
"OR";"This was a lot better then book #4. Thank god Zoe came around. I still think Emmi needs.to grow up."
"OR";"I am an avid shooter and firearms instructor and this bag is well thought out.  There is room for just about everything you need for a day at the range.  I wish there was more room for ammo but everything else fits great. I hold 4 handguns well and the design is well thought out."
"OR";"This was a nice story about the mom of the Brand  Gals, quite touching, sad, exciting. One of her better books and most of them I love."
"OR";"Desire: The Dining Club: Part One is the first short story in an eight part series. Since this is a short story, this review will be brief.

I don't really have much to say about it. The writing isn't awful, but it grows a bit redundant, vocabulary-wise (for example, David says a lot of things quiet"
"OR";"Great cheese grater rasp. Sharp, lightweight, easy to clean out. Cuts wood fast, and the blade is replaceable. I should have gotten this sooner."
"OR";"I bought this piece to put in my dining room and to pull together all the colors of my kitchen and living room and it did just the trick! Love this piece!"
"OR";"My cat has asthma and this litter has been a god-send. Clumps really, really well. I tried to switch her back to regular cat litter, but she began having asthma attacks again. This stuff works!  It does not cure her asthma, but is not as much of an irritant as regular litter."
"OR";"Worked fine.  Some post commented on foot pedal core being to short, seams long enough even when standing at a tall worktable."
"OR";"This movie somehow went under the radar, but I caught a trailer and decided to track it down. The vampires are kind of a bat / human hybrid, and look really cool. It has plenty of action and the story got me from the start. One of the best movies I've seen in a while."
"OR";"I bought this for a gift. My husband was very happy with it. Nice size, worked as expected. Good price - I looked around and bought here."
"OR";"I first saw this movie on TCM and/or AMC.  Can't remember which channel.  But it was such a good movie that I had to own it for myself.  You cannot go wrong with this one."
"OR";"I loved this tongue in cheek movie. It made fun of our macho superstar/sex symbols, who, true to Hollywood style, are usually, cool, smooth, strong and handsome idols. Clooney and Pitt were a scream, and Malkovich his usual hysterical self."
"OR";"I have to say that this was a very powerful movie that tells the truth of how addiction can take the life and talent of a young man and turn it upside down. A must see."
"OR";"I purchased this card as a last resort attempt to cure my wireless connection. We have a 2 family house with access points on the 1st and 2nd floor, it is not an overly large house but try as I might I could not get a consistent signal in parts of the house with the built in LAN card on my Gateway l"
"OR";"As described! My Labradoodle loves this brush. Well made, fits in the hand and the overall structure of the brush, makes grooming easy."
"OR";"MTECH has stepped their game up considerably ! This thing is indestructible ! Built like a tank and has a sweet sweet design ! Thank you MTECH .... Keep it up !"
"OR";"The seat is still way to wide for a mans exercise bike, but its much better than the stock seat supplied on the Schwinn Aerodyne AD6."
"OR";"It took me awhile before I really needed it, and it saved my vacation.  Firstly, when I received it (fast shipping) I mounted it under the water bottle cage and it fit in nicely.  Most of my friends didn't even know I had a pump with me.  I stashed all the other goodies in my bag guessing I wouldn't"
"OR";"Starting to have problems due to Carpel tunnels--this fixed the problem, good quality easy install, works great!"
"OR";"Great for end of the day cleaning of brushes with water and for deep stripping with brush cleaner.  Revived several quality brushes of mine."
"OR";"I like them very much. They are exactly the size you order in inches.  I Have a narrow foot and they fit much better than most other flip flops. Very comfortable."
"OR";"The Problem:
Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.

The Solution:
Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micr"
"OR";"I absolutely loved this book. It has everything. I know what it's like to live a life filled with pain and afraid to trust. I was just as lucky as these two were."
"OR";"This book was engaging until the last chapter. It was as if the author wrote the required number of pages and then just quit.  I would not waste my time on this book."
"OR";"GSD mix did ok with it tho she flipped it over. Lab puppy got the top off and played in it. Easy to clean and good quality."
"OR";"It's cute. It snows when you shake it, and it plays ""Let It Snow"" when you wind it up. In short, it does what snow globe is supposed to do. Oh and the owl is rather realistic looking."
"OR";"this stuff does what it is supposed to do. to the lady that said she has been using it on her kitten and its not working, you should still dip the whole kitten. That's probably why its not going away."
"OR";"Love this camcorder. It arrived on time and packaging was great! This is my first camcorder and love it. Video and sound quality is great!"
"OR";"I give this to Chase every morning. He is healthy happy and the vet says he looks good!
Dr Mercolas products are great!!"
"OR";"Just opened this package.  They are supposed to be a soft treat, but are not.  These are cute little flower like treats that are hard as a rock.  Just junk for small dog training.  Won't buy again.. Sell by date is later this year but no idea why these should be hard.  Save your money."
"OR";"Arrived right on schedule - well packaged - this fan will literally blow you away.  It's somewhat heavy but appears very well made.  Assembly was a snap. I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always us"
"OR";"Wow! Super sealing, super suction, totally heat resistant, covers frying things while holding in heat and cooking your frying things more evenly. I love these things. I have 3 containers with no matching covers. Not any more. Who thought of this stuff."
"OR";"I tried on our dog who is allergic to fleas and didn't work like said. arrived on time when said was pleased with sender just not product"
"OR";"Really nice lens. Pictures are very nice and crisp. Also makes my Canon become very compact and easier to store in my bag."
"OR";"I love these simple high tops. They fit better than expected considering I have wide feet. I got an 8.5 womens, which showed up as 6 mens... I was hesitant but they fit perfectly. Only downside is no arch support, which sucks if you have higher arches like I do."
"OR";"Great bow give it 4 stars because the string was cheap and started coming apart arfter 3 to 4 uses of the bow"
"OR";"I loved this TV series as a child of the 70's.  To get a complete TV series for this price is unheard of!!  By far, money best spent."
"OR";"Great  knife,  a good one to carry horizontal in my belt behind me,  You can get it quick,  in case of emergencys (maybe while hunting)....."
"OR";"Used this to spray over a little tikes slide. Went on great. Used whole can so recommend getting two if you are doing similar projects"
"OR";"Heartwarming!  Just a really good book.  You don't want it to end!  I can't wait to get my hands on the movie and watch it!"
"OR";"Awesome lock and the family loves it. Retrofit into existing deadbolt was able to cover the existing bored hole with a bit of the old boring showing (approx 2 mm). Acceptable but wish I would have installed it on a new slab!"
"OR";"I enjoyed this book very much.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a warm, fuzzy, heartwarming story."
"OR";"I got this for my son for Christmas a while back when it first came out... He barely played with it and lost most of the pieces. It's fairly annoying to set up and use."
"OR";"His writing has always kept me reading , not wanting to put the book down or miss something . Clever , informative and always a pleasure to read !"
"OR";"These bras are fantastic for nursing! They are very comfortable and functional. They are made of thicker cotton and are completely opaque unlike other similar bras. I would buy again."
"OR";"Granted it is expensive, but it is an excellent figure with a very detailed sculpting.  It does light up and has two different settings of lighting.  If you are a fan of Godzilla and have bought any of the other Bandai Tamashii Nations S.H. Monster Arts figures, than you will want to add this figure"
"OR";"An amazing book by an amazing warrior. I have the utmost respect for our Navy SEAL teams. Proud to be an American...I will never forget these men and the fight they fought..."
"OR";"I'm pretty sure I reviewed this product already, but here goes again. These are a little higher than some out there, but I have problems with my feet so the soft insides of these are just what I needed."
"OR";"The story was well written and I enjoyed reading about this time frame in Canada. Interesting to read about women's suffrage in Boston and Canada."
"OR";"I enjoyed the setting and the characters. The twist with the magical jukebox gave it an interesting vibe. A well written love story."
"OR";"The Milkshake stays nice and cold in this, and feels like you're drinking a milkshake from an authentic fountain - a must have for milkshake or smoothie lovers!"
"OR";"Typical for Triple K Leather,,,it's excellent. Good heavy leather, good stitching, and color. It fits my knife perfectly."
"OR";"Everyone said it was too small and to order a size up. I ordered a large and it was too big. Going to exchange for a medium because otherwise, it's a cute top."
"OR";"They are great but I have some problems with them.  I have a very heavy head and they are flat as a pancakes, but Ill put up another review later.  To tell you what I think.  This is only a few weeks now."
"OR";"I bought this to monitor my heart rate after a triple bypass. Seems to be a high quality product. They use these at the cardiac rehab facility."
"OR";"just blank or empty containers to hold dvd's.  shipped fairly fast and will meet my needs for storing dvd's.

  cheap enough also."
"OR";"Really like this band. great quality and awesome clasp. Would purchase wider versions for some of my other watches. Recommend."
"OR";"Great floor puzzle, vibrant colors and large floor size pieces.  I love that the pieces easily fit together and lay flat.  Nothing is more frustrating for kiddos then when the pieces won't lay flat!!  Would certainly purchase again."
"OR";"Not sure where it was going but it kept me riveted.  I pretty much can count on Elin to give me a great story every time and this was no exception."
"OR";"Que tremendo reloj, todas las funciones que trae son buenisimas y funcionan al 100%, lo recomiendo a las personas de buen gusto. casio 1005 original..."
"OR";"I really enjoyed this book!! I would recommend this book to any one who likes a good mystery story book."
"OR";"Love, love, love Joan Rivers and this book didn't disappoint. Recommended reading if you need to laugh out loud."
"OR";"We bought these to give our kitchen an inexpensive update. They are heavy duty with a quality finish and was a great value buying in a 25 pack."
"OR";"I have 4 of these in the Natural color. I use them as drawers on my record player holder. They hold a lot for their size! And the Natural color matches any furniture."
"OR";"Anyone who loves the Harry Potter movies will of course love these books.  If you haven't seen the movies, read these first!"
"OR";"I had never heard the story of the nurses left behind during the wars. A few of the nurses stories written with integrity and perspective that can only come from the passing of time."
"OR";"One star less because of it being made of plastic. Other than that, it works quite well.  This one is for Lift Bowl not for Tilt Head Mixer."
"OR";"Seems bright on max and at that level should work well for plants.  But the 24/7 option is ridiculous.  You'll have light on your tank for like 16 hours at some level or another and half the time the light is dim.  Cant beat the price though."
"OR";"This is a great product but I attempted twice to order it and both times received only a single bottle of Urine Gone and not the kit.  I will of course be refunded but what a waste of my time it has been.  Please beware that if you order from this listings fulfilled by Amazon there is a great chance"
"OR";"The pillowcases arrived early, which was very much appreciated because the pillow arrived the day before. The pillowcases are very soft and fit the pillow exactly. I am very pleased with this purchase."
"OR";"Worth the purchase, sure grabs those dust bunnies (and rabbits!) With wood floors this is really a plus much better than dust mop."
"OR";"Good but far from Gladwell's best.  The argument that small is better was a bit of a stretch.  I do appreciate the style and detail that Gladwell offers."
"OR";"FAILS after 15 mos.  plastic deteriorated, over-heated, dimmer-dial broke
- initially operated cool but apparently started overheating and burned itself up ...
so sad."
"OR";"I bought this train set to for my three year old grandson to use with the Step 2 Deluxe Canyon Road & Train Track."
"OR";"Bought for wide width, but disappointed.  Last year got a pairs of Clark shoes same size and they were perfect.  Disappointed in this pair."
"OR";"GREAT case for the 2014 Kindle Fire HD 7 - holds it very securely, doesn't cover up the battery hole, the camera or anything."
"OR";"Delete it quickly and save yourself the time wasted even overusing this really bad romance novel.  proves anyone can write trash"
"OR";"This is great crock pot carrier!! It has straps to help keep lids on you crockpot. It is insulated to help keep food warm while transporting."
"OR";"This was a very enjoyable storyline with lots of interesting characters, most from previous stories in this series.
This was not one of my favorite books or storylines, but overall it was okay."
"OR";"The Dreamaway Comfort Fill Mattress Protector was good for a while but then problems arose.  First was that the fill compressed in the center, which created a shallow dip in the center.  Next the top material pilled too much; some pilling was expected but this became too excessive."
"OR";"A nice bell that I have attached to my 13 yrs old female dog's collar so I can hear her when she gets up to pee. She has an issue with drinking a lot of water and peeing a lot which results in accidents. This helps me recognize her needs so we have no more indoor accidents."
"OR";"By no means is this a great literary work, however, that said, I found it to be a satisfying autobiography in the Horatio Alger vein and an easy read.  Mr. Brown's life achievements to date are to be appreciated and he has recorded them in great detail and with pride, to which he is properly entitle"
"OR";"Franco's acting is great as ""Gator."" Statham is Statham...  kicking booty and taking names.  Great movie for a movie-night at home."
"OR";"I read reviews and was advised to order a smaller size- man... was that the wrong move. Order in your cup size or it will be an immediate return."
"OR";"Great spin to the story, characters were great. Can't wait to hear Nash story and how his mind is working with all that he has gone through."
"OR";"Not making it draw high current (<1amp). That said, it works as supposed to as far as providing space saving in comparison to a straight in plug."
"OR";"I love this bootie, however I wish they had the purple in my size 81/2 m I will be buying more. My feet were comfortable all day. when you get this fashion in my size in a  purple size 81/2 (M) please contact me so I can purchase. I'll be waiting to hear from you. :)

Thanks Much,
Barbara D."
"OR";"I enjoyed this book SO MUCH!!!!! I would encourage anyone looking for a suspenseful love story to definitely purchase this one."
"OR";"When I have to read the description of the book to give it a rating it was most likely not worth the read. If you want to kill time and spend $2.99 to do it it's your choice."
"OR";"Purchased specifically for a GoPro hero 3+ Black.  It's on the GoPro recommended SD Card list and is capable of recording 4K video.  Very fast."
"OR";"Much more than a neurology exposition, Eagleman connects a lot of dots in a lot of areas: including philosophy, politics, jurisprudence, anthropology, linguistics, sports, therapy, religion and more. It shifts the paradigm, the perception of reality is no longer reliable."
"OR";"Looks really nice on our wall. It was pretty easy to setup and color matches web picture pretty well also."
"OR";"These China flats are cute, but, true to form, they are not very supportive or comfortable. We ended up sharing them with a friend for her costume. They were inexpensive, and sometimes you get what you pay for."
"OR";"Perfect! The best panties I've  worn in a long time. Comfy and just enough lite control that you want. I'll be back for more!!"
"OR";"Khiava dry heaves sometimes, but since taking these treats (which she absolutely loves) there's been less of that, and no hairballs! That's an A+ in my book."
"OR";"I bought 5 of these--1 for each grandkid--for Christmas.  Now in April, they stills use hem. I taught them how to play fflashlight tag.  Price was a real bargain.  i also use one on my night-tablele so i don' t kick into the furniture on my way to the bathroom in the middle of he night."
"OR";"Schleich makes the best animal figures.  Very detailed and well made.  I don't think kids can hurt it.  Pay more, but worth it."
"OR";"What a great look into to past history of USA.  Words come directly from the journal of Solomon.  Very authentic.  Very sad part of our history of cruelty."
"OR";"Edit: Next day, friends over for barbeque. Knives were the center of attention. These colorful tools made fast work of steaks, by cut right through whole filet, and prepared assorted melons in record time. Ordered second set over dinner!

After using my pocket knife to cut a canteloupe, I decided it"
"OR";"Daughter loved her gift this year, sparkle uggs. There not only cute but they are warm as well. I wish Santa brought me a pair of Uggs."
"OR";"Oh how this would have benefited from editing to reduce the detail, add more action and lower the page count. I had to take a break after Part Two and read another book before returning to Part Three. I did want to know how it ended but it was a chore to finish."
"OR";"An A-student's life is turned upside-down when inappropriate status updates and photos appear on her online profile. Soon, she learns that even her life is in danger."
"OR";"This serves the purpose that it was designed to do, and was delivered promptly. It is as described. However, one complaint I have is that the shelves are not re-inforced with any type of material (like cardboard), so they sag in the middle. Imagine thin fabric shelves rather than structured ones. Ot"
"OR";"This adjustable wrench is fine for small jobs. There were some burrs on the adjustment screw and the overall finish is fairly cheap. Note that this is made in China."
"OR";"What can I say besides this was an awesome series and book 3 was the best of them all because the author kept up with the storyline and didn't stray. Vivian,your penmanship is amazing and your creativity is out this world and you didn't disappoint because you really brought your A Game on this one. "
"OR";"These are cute, but very small. The pictures make them seem large and even though I checked the measurements, they still seemed small. Some of the drawstrings are not stitched correctly so they are fraying. Plus my order was missing a few bags. But they worked as party favor holders, which is what I"
"OR";"Well, this was just a wonderful book. I've read a few of Kenny Wright's stories now, and really enjoy his light and bouncy style, and the fantastic suspense that just keeps you captivated - and unable to keep from turning to the next chapter time after time.

This is his first full-length novel, and"
"OR";"I like this shampooer. I no longer have carpet but if I ever do, I will definitely get another one. I also used it for cleaning my microfiber furniture."
"OR";"This movie is wonderful with a touch of cheesiness I look for in movies of this genre.  The child actors are much more disturbing than the movie itself, but that has to be seen to be believed..."
"OR";"Wow,

  This is not clumping litter so forget the poop and scoop process. It is basically non clumping liter. I like Arm and Hammer but this is a horrible product."
"OR";"Book 2 was amazing, I can't wait to read the next one.  This is a fun Seri e s and worth picking up."
"OR";"Totally cushy and comfy for walking the dog.  Practically weightless but fit me like a glove.  I wear a size 7 shoe.  Easy to slip on to go outside.  I get compliments on how cute they are.  Nice alternative to sandals or full shoe."
"OR";"The pewter AVENGERS logo is pretty enough but I was disappointed to discover it was a safety pin style back pin instead of a 2 pc stick pin and backing. The latch pin style rarely lasts long."
"OR";"A lot less grip than I had envisioned.  I have thin fingers and the grips just didn't fit right.  Finish on the grips is excellent, just didn't care for them."
"OR";"Perfect for my Cat Food on Top and my Dog Food on the Bottom and store the bags in the pantry. Best price ever on Amazon compared to the popular Pet Stores. LOVE it!  It rolls around and is so handy when feeding hungry cats and dogs."
"OR";"Wonderful item. Great height for toddlers! My son is almost 18 months and enjoys this item very much! I highly recommend it :)"
"OR";"The print is good, don't care much for the feel of the fabric. Not a big deal, it's more of a once a month scrub anyway. Lots of compliments and comments on it."
"OR";"This was a great purchase for an Easter basket. I think we got it for around $4 and since there are multiple options of what to build, it provided hours of entertainment. They are small enough to keep in a small space, but remember with any Legos, the small pieces are easy to lose."
"OR";"It is nice fits great but short can't wear it out. Hugs the body nice.looks good on her but too short.she is 5.6 talk.fun for home."
"OR";"If you are confused about a situation or relationship in your life Dr. Cloud's book will give lots to evaluate and think about and point you toward possible solutions"
"OR";"This is a great active adapter. I purchased a radeon r9 390 that didn't like my HDMI to DVI cable I had been using on my old card for my separate monitor. Since switching to this adapter things are working great and both of my monitors are correctly detected."
"OR";"These pants fit very well. I'm thinking about ordering more colors. The only downside id's that they seem to attract more pet hair than other materials."
"OR";"Not much to say, really, my little Dremel is now workable again. I couldn't find this at any local store so I was happy to find this at a good price."
"OR";"As always, I love these sandals!  Bought my 5th or 6th pair over the last 5-6 years!  Wouldn't go with anything else!"
"OR";"Really cute! Can't wait to give this to my 2.5 year old when I have his brother. I think it will make him feel super special :)"
"OR";"Nice action figure for my daughter. Not fully posable, but still fun for her to play with.  Nice big size for small hands."
"OR";"I assumed purchasing this light that for the price it would burn out immediately.  Not only has that not happened but I have owned it for over a year now and it is as good as new.  Buy with confidence."
"OR";"Like Damages, saw all episodes, but it got to where there was to much dirty language and sex. I don't care for that. Movies can be just as good without all the bad language and sex scenes. Otherwise the story line and acting was good. Glen Close was a monster."
"OR";"The batteries are longer than the one that came with the X5C and the plug requires more force to plug in and remove. Aside from that, they're perfectly fine batteries."
"OR";"Well written. Interesting. Very long. Wish there was a bit more on Cook and a little less on the modern aspects of his exploring. Knowledgable author."
"OR";"case back cracked on corners within first week and proceded to warp.  The case would not stay attached to the ipad, it simply fell off after being attached.  The JETech slim-fit case is a much better choice for a budget case"
"OR";"Great story. Classic Leonard style. Gritty, simple prose that has power way beyond the words. Read it and enjoy it."
"OR";"This is the kind of glove I used years ago as a kid. They fit well and are comfortable. Great retro look as well."
"OR";"Good price and work well.
Given in party bags and the kids thought they were cool.
Would buy these pens again."
"OR";"This is the first book of Mrs. Montgomery that I've read, and I'm glad I did.  The premise of a colony ship having to settle the wrong planet, and how their society dealt with that was an interesting one.  The end of the book leaves the situation unresolved, and I eagerly await the sequel."
"OR";"So nice to just reach over and tap it to turn it off.  They look nice also.  They are small so they don't take up too much room on the night stand."
"OR";"It isn't easy for Zac, coming of age in a small Missouri town in the 1960s. People think hes slow. Thats not true, but he would rather they thought that than know the truth. While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor "
"OR";"Very soft and pliable but smaller than realized. Curled up it fits in hand. Really soft and not hard plastic so was pleased with that and detail was nice."
"OR";"I bought this after my husband's kayak went under a log and he lost his paddle - which we thankfully recovered.  He uses this all the time now.  The length is great and there have been no issues since."
"OR";"This works well and sucking gunk out of window sills.  However, it will NOT charge.  It only worked for 5 weeks and now will not charge.  Of course, my ""return"" window closed after 45 weeks, so I am now out $32.  I won't order from Black & Decker through Amazon again.  Very disappointed."
"OR";"Super soft and comfortable, pockets are extremely small you can't really use them for much. These are great for sleeping in or hitting the gym."
"OR";"Not as strong an opening action as my previous TAC Force knives, but still good.  Clip is a little bit large for my taste, too."
"OR";"Bought for fellow teacher who has her classroom decorated in Seahawks fun. (Even her students bought Seahawk shirts to go impress the teacher!"
"OR";"Love this Advent calendar.  It is adorable.  Just wish the company would have more selection than the night before Christmas one more that I can't remember the name."
"OR";"It's perfect for learning how to use eye contact. I have used its ideas and have learned how to make conversation with men better and especially with woman."
"OR";"I like this story line,Champion ,Jax and Mitch that was a crazy situation. Ajax wasn't a good friend doing scandalous things to his son."
"OR";"I love this set.  The solid little flipper thingy is perfect for stir fries and the fork is great for doing scrambled eggs in the skillet."
"OR";"This movie wasn't meant to be a documentary. It was just a vehicle for some good ole good guy beats the heck outta the bad guy movie. It exceeded my expectations. Even though I've seen this movie many times, I contine to enjoy it."
"OR";"I actually used this in a washer and dryer closet. This works well, it's bright and protective jar glass keeps me from breaking the bulb."
"OR";"Really really loved it.  She always writes an excellent book.  I can hardly wait for the next one.  Thanks very much."
"OR";"These breetches meet their claim for being cool but do snag easily, especially on my half chap inside zipper.  They also run a little big."
"OR";"As usual, a great read.  I love the way he writes.  My favorite author.  I wonder some time where he gets his great ideas."
"OR";"I recently read Douglas Adams' increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy in its entirety over a rather short period of time (not recommended, you'll have difficulty integrating your world with Adams').  Looking back, this first book was one of the more hilarious of the five.  It is charac"
"OR";"Love this movie never gets old and I'm 28. But I always rent it for my 2 year old she loves it."
"OR";"I use this weekly at work as a under shirt when working in freezers. Keeps me warm and doesnt make me sweat and freeze like thermals."
"OR";"I ordered this for my teen son, he loves the book.  I was kind of surprised how much I had to pay but I guess this book is still popular."
"OR";"I enjoy this movie, and decided to get the blu ray instead of the criterion edition. This was a horrible mistake. The blu ray has no special features, not even a commentary(the criterion has 3). I will be purchasing the criterion edition sometime in the future."
"OR";"This was a short but very sweet story. Beaston received a even happier ending. Just imaging all these wild men becoming fathers is so heart warming."
"OR";"As good as the top ratings suggested. Does as excellent job with uniform grinding. My only tiny complaint is that I'd like to grind only 2 scoops at a time but 4 is the smallest. Not a big deal.  I'll likely give these as gifts to my coffee-loving friends."
"OR";"Good movie! Can't wait to see the new one!! Not a lot of curse words. Action packed. Highly recommended."
"OR";"Doc Martin is a tremendously entertaining character on television.  While he's such an abominable human being, he is a highly skilled physician and an incredibly vulnerable soul.  The lively banter between characters and the comedic situations continue to amuse in season 3."
"OR";"I love this stuff. So far, I have used it in the garden as a topic treatment to keep racoons and opossums from making a home, used it as a topical rub to remove paint and stain from my hands, used it as a de-greaser in the laundry and a bunch of other things.
This stuff is awesome!"
"OR";"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the 16 movie version is not legit.  The DVD menus are just a still image.  There is absolutely no copy write information on anything or any warnings...  Each dvd just has a still image with the list of movies at the bottom to select.  I noticed the audio cutting in and out and "
"OR";"Does a good job of removing small animal urine from the cage and hamster ball. I does not leave any residue and the smell goes away once you wipe it off. The bottle last us 4-5 months with us cleaning three cages weekly."
"OR";"Bought an adult small for my 11 year old son, who is about 5 ft 2 inches 83 lbs and it fits well. I was worried about the 100% cotton shirt shrinking, but the shirt hasn't really shrunk since buying it."
"OR";"She loves them. When she hears one rattle, her little ears perk up and she's ready to go after it. She has us laughing with her antics with these toys."
"OR";"Hated the story line. It was basically a string of cameo opportunities for Bollywood stars to show up. It tried to mix a serious story with too much light humor. Then it was scary. This movie couldn't make up its mind what genre it was. Don't waste your time."
"OR";"My and my children absolutely love this movie.  Ever since it arrived we have watched it every day. It was in perfect condition.  Thank you so much."
"OR";"Idea of having a collapsible rack wasn't why I purchased it but I have found this useful.  Nice and deep and can store plenty on it so really because it is deep it takes up less space than other racks.  Very sturdy and even with a lot of heavy items on it it was very easy to move.  Highly recommend."
"OR";"So comfortable, i am a size 12 dress size women with a 38D top and this fits perfect and comfortable , great quality"
"OR";"Well built and holds up better than a Harris I will definitely buy another one it pans and canters something my Harris can't do without a $75 add on this thing rocks, hooks right and my sling attaches easily a must buy"
"OR";"The glove is very comfortable and well made. Recommend size 1/2 larger than normal. Thumb was too long but acceptable for driving purposes."
"OR";"Who wouldn't want to get top scores on video games with ease? Who wouldn't want to be a master of trivia of movies, music, and computer gaming from the 1980s? Who wouldn't want to be a master computer programmer/hacker? Quite the fantasy, for some, I guess."
"OR";"Kept losing air. pump it up and hours later too soft to use. Wish I had returned it within the 30 days. Headed to garbage now."
"OR";"I like the color and that it has 2 doors but the latches are a hassle. You have to make sure they are moved out of the way before you try to close the  door and it's takes twice as long since there are 2 latches on each door. The paint is already chipping around the latches."
"OR";"If you want a aquarium heater. These are the best. I have 6x tanks all have two heaters. One primary and one secondary. I have had to replace one bad heater in 5 years. The average. 1 in 12 heaters will fail In 5 years."
"OR";"Its a lot bigger than you expect from looking at the online picture, if you love big purses then this is for you . I love it and am going to get more colors"
"OR";"Nobody's Fault was very well written and the author uses descriptions and dialogue with expertise and care. The story itself was told well and the loose ends tied together nicely in the end. The author wove multiple points of view from different perspectives about the same incidents and gave us a cl"
"OR";"The device stopped functioning after the first use. Changed battery a few times but would not power on or record audio when attached to the camera. The build felt cheap and I regret not saving a little and going with something a bit more expensive with higher quality."
"OR";"This is a really beautiful copper cup, all copper including the handle, with a logo printed (?) on the bottom. I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, "
"OR";"I received this product with an expiration date for last April. Didn't work well. The yeast didn't activate. I am very disappointed with this product."
"OR";"Like most work of Jody Picoult, I enjoyed this book. There is a great story with believable characters even if somewhat unconventional."
"OR";"looked at this saw at a big box store, and it was quite a bit more in price there. have one in my shop, and once in awhile have to go to a place where there is no close power  for a corded saw. handy to have for outside work, and don't feel nervous using it in a wet environment."
"OR";"This is an excellent addition to a Thomas and Friends wooden railroad set.  I remember watching Thomas the Tank when I was a kid.  It was a fantastic show then and is still a big hit with kids.  This quarry mine tunnel adds an interesting addition to any track."
"OR";"I bought a few of these for our family's LG smart phones and they work great so far. No issues, good quality, would buy again."
"OR";"My Golden Retriever has plaque problems and very bad breath.
The petzlife spray has heped remove some of that plaque and certainly helps with bad breath.
Don't expect it to completely clean the teeth.
I would recommend it even though it is costly."
"OR";"These hangers are heavy duty and I have a closet full of them. I could not find these hangers in the stores so on line shopping was the best value. I will order more when needed."
"OR";"my daughter loves this movie!! such a good deal!!! the 80s my little ponies are so much more fun to watch then the new ones!!!"
"OR";"Good quality, however, the fit is not correct for the pot size.  It is wobbly and loose.  Okay for my uses.  Handle does get hot as cooking continues so caution is advised.  The hollow button metal handles don't seem to have as much as an issue."
"OR";"I gave myself this Nano qx fpv w tx from Spektrum-Fatshark collaboration and it gave me just as much fun(probably more) as my Lionel train set at the age of 12. It is a great tool for learning fpv. I'm making great progress quickly. A Must-Buy."
"OR";"they stick great on sand textured walls. my 9 year old grand daughter had a great time decorating her bedroom."
"OR";"My kids love dinosaurs. We had something similar that we purchased from a museum, but some of them went missing. So, we got these as a replacement. More than half of them were deformed and had no faces."
"OR";"Another great book!!! Dated during my growing up years but the story line is very interesting. Hope to read more from the deaf man!!"
"OR";"Had to shut this one off about 20 mins in.  Thank goodness our Society is more vocal about not tolerating teacher's inappropriate behavior to the minor-aged student.  It's not funny, it's a crime."
"OR";"Stainless Steel covers on the electrical is supposed to be ""industrial"" and I wanted to give my apartment that clean industrial look. These really made that happen."
"OR";"This fits well and is super cute. I am a size 12 but order plus size in lingerie like this since the one size is a bit tight. The larger size is super stretchy and would do well for a size 16-18 girl too, but for me it is sexy but not constricting."
"OR";"Reminds me of this one time at camp as a kid.....There were all these lights and these little guys in silver suits. That's all I can remember. But it's like that but better."
"OR";"I've been very pleased with these leggings. I'm 5'11"" and usually a L/XL size that says it will fit me, does not.  I was very impressed that these DID fit. They ended about 3 inches above my ankles, but could be pulled lower, resulting in a thinner, stretched legging.
 I was also impressed with how "
"OR";"Ordered this on Amazons last minute deals. This is super cute. It's durable and fun. He talks when you pull an arm or leg or poke his eye. He says funny things like ""hey watch it, i need that arm for scaring."" Good buy."
"OR";"Good looking friend for Barbie, but he doesn't many joints for posing.  He's got on a nice outfit, fairly good quality, and looks a lot like Ryan does in the 'Life in the Dreamhouse' series- big selling point for me, I love that show."
"OR";"Kept me from a bathroom remodel. I love the look of my retro bathroom but the holder was about to be replaced when someone suggested I try this. It works perfectly."
"OR";"I have the h600w and the h600 and if you have a chance, get the h600 instead, it is quite a bit brighter and the white light is much easier to see with then the yellow light that the h600w puts out. But this h600w light isn't terrible or anything, I just recommend the h600 zebralight more."
"OR";"This  device is a bargain at the price. It is great for travel or home use. A negative is that the user manual is poorly translated into English from (I assume) Chinese."
"OR";"This bas a gift.  I heard that is was received well and that my grandson will soon be immersed in the folklore of the middle east.  In the current social climate that may not be the best idea, but certainly the Arabian Nights have become interwoven into our Western culture as well."
"OR";"I bought several different styles and lengths and love them all.  They arrived quickly, packaged well and the best part is that they are MADE IN USA."
"OR";"The stand is perfect for raising the TV enough to be able to place the Blue-Ray player underneath.  The setup looks nicely organized and neat."
"OR";"These are very nice and as close as I could find to a beloved pair of ACORN slippers that I bought a few years ago. These are not as sturdy feeling as that paid but still this is a great slipper. It feels almost like a shoe, so you are not shuffling around in it like floppy slippers."
"OR";"This is a really nice....the pendant has some weight to it which I really like and the chain is strong and longer than usual. It was purchased as a substitute for the real thing because I do not wear or take real jewelry pieces with me when I travel.  Received numerous compliments and am finding thi"
"OR";"If you have a dog that is a stool eater this is a great product.  I have used ot over the years and suggested to friends too.  My first choice to use"
"OR";"This is an excellent book, I loveed thee audio versin, could not get any better. This book is amust for any science lover!!!!"
"OR";"For lack of cliche's I'll say this one is a nailbiter. Imagine being confronted with your certain death, but then given a chance to prolong or relive seven hours of your life. Dan gets this opportunity to beat certain fate and make it up with his presence, and it's a race against time to get what he"
"OR";"Purchased these to make some sharp cheddar cheese and they worked great - or so I hope. Won't know if it's sharp cheese for another few months.."
"OR";"My daughter likes it.  But the first time she used it, one of the colors broke off.  Then the inside got wet and softened the other colors.  She can still use it, but as soon as the warm water hit it, its like a clay texture.  She gets it under her finger nails and it makes more work for me."
"OR";"Ordered half size larger due to recommendations. Couldn't be happier. Fits great and no sign of premature wear yet."
"OR";"I can't believe these are veterinary approved.  Just smell one and that should tip you off....smells like chemicals.  Evidently my dogs think so too, because they will not eat them."
"OR";"Replacement for one stolen in home burglary, so exactly like that one. Does its job well. How much can you say about a pry bar?"
"OR";"Nice cape! It really made my costume complete. Dark green velvet with tie at neck. One suze fits all"
"OR";"These units are subpar at best, bought 9 of them, 5 of them are NOT working less than 4 months later.  Cheap quality, not durable."
"OR";"This book is with his business partner Aaron. I liked it because Aaron didn't know it was Harriet but acted like it was. Then she talks about bringing her friend into the business and I don't know how I feel about that. Maybe a foursome first????? LOL I don't know but can't wait for more"
"OR";"The best there is. Uses a DVI video connection, should be HDMI in 2016. That is a little out of date, had to buy an adapter, no problem though. Love it."
"OR";"worst usb hub-- installed fake drive on the system and disabled other ports ----STAY AWAY--TOOK OUR TECH 2 HRS TO CLEAR UP THE SYSTEM"
"OR";"Arrived in good shape, little yellow and it was falling apart but when I noticed the plant had a bunch of babies. Let see how the plant improves"
"OR";"I couldn't stream content off of the device to anything. I gave up shortly after I got it and sent it back. Not worth the money, the app and device just 'aren't' there."
"OR";"Good quality, nice material and appearance, good thermal properties, pretty much as advertised but I have had more effective blackout curtains."
"OR";"LOVE LOVE LOVE-  Was looking for the perfect bag to go clubbing.  This is adorable, dark, and a backpack...  What more could you ask???"
"OR";"Interesting structure of writing.  It spanned four generations in few pages.  Some sadness.  It a good that when there's life there's hope.  Joan should not have given up'"
"OR";"I did not find the answer cards as funny as a lot of the original black box cards are.  The question cards were not all that great either.  It was fine to pick through to grab a few out and put in the main deck, but I would not buy any future packs unless they are on a good discount."
"OR";"I bought them in black after loving them in brown.

They are lightweight, cuter than Emus, and way more economical than Uggs.  They are warm and comfortable enough for all day wear. After a few wears, they soften and are more wearable.

I don't know how they would hold up in actual snow, but they ar"
"OR";"absolute waste of time and money , packed with bloatware and crappy windows 8 , ad pop-ups all over the place and windows 8 sucks anyway"
"OR";"I had these dishes previously in another color and when I decided to change the color scheme in my kitchen I went looking for new dishes. Love these so much and nothing else compared to the quality, price, and look that I just went ahead an ordered them again in the new color."
"OR";"These broke fairly easily and are a bit light.  Better to purchase heavier dominoes for rallies.  Great idea, just sort of cheap"
"OR";"The construction is good; the functionality is nice; the versatility is neat; the battery life is positively impressive. Overall this is a really good product."
"OR";"Command hooks have come a long way since the white plastic products. The metal hooks are nice, but  a little pricey."
"OR";"It heats my bedroom perfectly and I can turn down the central heating system to save money on the gas bill (we have solar panels that saves us on electricity)."
"OR";"Perfect ending to the series.

Ms. Shaw kept us hooked until the very end. No more cliffhangers, mysteries solved and a forever romance is born."
"OR";"Highly recommend. I have others of these and grandson never gets tired of them. Watch out for tiny pieces if  you have a child who puts things in their mouths however, but it's the silverware/plates/cups only on that. The set will not hurt anyone otherwise, just forewarning grandparents if the littl"
"OR";"Nora Roberts hasn't lost her touch.  She can build the suspense until you feel it in your bones.  Good storyline with characters that are believable and brings you into the family."
"OR";"Installed in a closet in my 110 year old house.  Easy install, but use an LED so you won't have to change bulbs often!"
"OR";"They work, but sometimes dog doesnt go on center of pad. Oh well, helped while training my dog to go outside"
"OR";"I though a square cake pan would be great but is hard to cut and display on a round cake stand. I will have to purchase a square stand."
"OR";"I have been an avid  fan of Clive Cussler from the very beginning.
Is this book to be taken as an adventure etc....LOL. It feels more like reading for a young adolescent"

"OR";"Great Price for a great set of movies.  Highly recommend.  Fun to see Bruce age as the movies progress..."
"OR";"I like the K'NEX race cars because it combines building and imaginative play for my children. They like the drivers and different cars that K'NEX makes and also the little men that ride in the cars, they use them to play with other toys too. It's a big hit at my house!"
"OR";"I loved watching him make this.  My only complaint is that the items fall off easily.  If only we had thought to use wood glue, we wouldn't have lost pieces."
"OR";"Great way to help my four year old grandchildren learn to tell time on a non-digital clock!  Also a good way to help young children count by five, to notice shapes, to illustrate the number of minutes in an hour."
"OR";"I LOVED  this book!!!!!!!!! It was the first time I LoVED a Wendy mass story it was great .I think 2 will be better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"OR";"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie.  Slow to start as characters are being developed but a really great tear jerker.  Happy tears."
"OR";"Fits my 9 and 10 year old grand kids just fine and does the job. Great price, great value, and very adjustable. I read most all the reviews and they told it correctly. Thank you for the reviews on products because that is how we know if they are what we think they are. 10 year-old is 120 lbs."
"OR";"I am really impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. They are very comfortable and I love the fact that they fold up. I wish the plug was angled,but this is a minor issue."
"OR";"Greata ngrandson loves his new Elmo, it goes everywhere with him.  He is learning how to sing along with Elmo.  Great learning toy."
"OR";"This book l was a short, erotic read. I did enjoy it, but it was too short for my reading preferences. Hence, only a 4-star. But still an enjoyable read."
"OR";"Cute.  Grandson loved them.  They are just a bit larger than matchbox cars.  They seemed a bit pricey since you can get a regular matchbox or hotwheel car for $1, but these do seem to be a bit heavier and well built, and of course, they are the Avengers, so Grandson loved them."
"OR";"Not hilarious funny, but fun to watch. I wouldn't be tempted to watch again though. Good cast, looks like they had fun making it."
"OR";"My go to for grouper trolling.  It's durable but hooks didn't last long and needed to be replaced after short use in salt water."
"OR";"I wasn't impressed with this. My dog figured out how to fully open the little food door very quickly, so it didn't keep her occupied long."
"OR";"This sleeper is very high quality.  It is soft and cute, and very easy to put on and take off for diaper changes.  I highly recommend this for your child! ADORABLE!"
"OR";"I bought this for my son. He opened it yesterday and it is BROKEN today. He didn't do anything crazy.... it is just a poorly made toy. DON'T BUY THIS."
"OR";"No gain control and the volume is extremely low.  Can't returned it as it is past 30 days.  I only use the USB feature now to play mp3s."
"OR";"Over the Christmas holidays, I read several books celebrating the special holiday. This particular book was so touching and brought back some of my childhood Christmas memories. The short stories were all different and unique to the particular author. It was a beautiful look into their lives and mos"

"OR";"I couldn't put this book down.  A marvelous young heroine learns so much and shares so much. I look forward to her future adventures!"
"OR";"They look nothing like the picture. Overpriced for what we got. Caveat emptor.
Oh well. Four-year old doesn't mind."
"OR";"Excellent remake of cinderella...with a good moral story line. Da Vinci painting was excellent, but he was more philosopher than I would expect."
"OR";"I replaced an older button lock set with the Yale lock on , and it worked out great.  I particularly like that it is backlit, and it is an attractive lock."
"OR";"This would hypothetically be a fantastic way to burn incense if it worked. However, incense will not stay lit when using this holder. You will have to light an incense 20 times for it to burn the entire way to the end of the stick. Stay far far away from this."
"OR";"Once again the Mess Woods book opens more questions than she answers. In this second novel the Incorrigible Children are brought to London, the rest is a merry chase."
"OR";"I had a hard time contacting the manufacturer/distributor in order to make sure the measurements were correct. The description and the .pdf have completely different dimensions.
In reality, these didn't fit at all. Extremely short!
Fabric is very thin. I consider these are well overpriced for what t"
"OR";"Solid chair.  Very comfortable.  Have tried many other folks chairs at the various sporting events I go to for my children. This is by far the best overall."
"OR";"The mix of history and fiction is enough to make one wonder what if. Once you've read far enough along you get lost in it."
"OR";"Buy it. The office will love it. Note: it doesn't hold up well with magnets so put it on the wall. We leave whoever said turn it is, the bag. This way, people easily know because it's hard to tell just zipping by. May have to get another small token?"
"OR";"Once you get used to the settings, it makes deliciously, moist meats!!
We seared our meat for just a couple minutes after cooking. It is a great kitchen addition and would highly recommend!
We put the seasoned meats in one sealed bag, veggies in another."
"OR";"The Bletchley Circle is another example of great British shows. While it's Sherlock Holmes it's a great series and well worth your time."
"OR";"This stuff is AMAZING! I have a beloved oriental rug and a little dog that had an accident. I was terrified of using a cleaner that would ruin the handmade rug. I also needed to get the odor out. This stuff did it! It gently cleaned the rug and got the order out! Love it!"
"OR";"This is a good product. Four USB ports, each with their own on/off switch. More importantly, it rotates to get it out of your way. And it can handle daisy-chaining usb hubs."
"OR";"The Darling is a magnificent book, far ranging and very compelling. Russell Banks, like Wally Lamb, writes authentically in the voice of a woman, so much so that it is hard to believe this book was really written by a man.

The woman's voice is that of Hannah Musgrave Sundiata, a.k.a. Dawn Carringto"
"OR";"This thing works great scares the crap out of poor cat but keeps her from trying to catch baseballs on my 70"" TV screen"
"OR";"Well, you have to wear white otherwise you see right through it. The fabric is so thin anything dark like a lanyard with your ID is very visible."
"OR";"Bought this for my boyfriend who loves Doctor Who, and I've gotta say I was impressed this watch is stunning- definitely worth the money!"
"OR";"Wow! This book is awesome. I don't even have words to describe how great. Add this to your MUST READ! I loved it T. K."
"OR";"I got these in gold and in the natural leather. So comfortable and feminine. I would buy these in every color if the heel could be covered in leather too."
"OR";"Granddaughter wore for 3 straight days after opening at Christmas! She even moved her dolls bed in next to hers and laid the pj's out for her to wear them the next night.  As soon as they were out of the laundry, they are back on her each night! Nice quality cotton, cute design."
"OR";"Hard to drink out of, since the structure ""collapses"" when you grip the ""glass"". The silicone is not firm enough so you have to get used to the glass to not spill the wine."
"OR";"I'm reading every Harry Bosch novel I can get.  I am addicted to these stories.  As soon as I finish one, I start another."
"OR";"Quality abounds in this series. From costumes, to setting choices, to scenery to acting, it is flawless.  I felt as though I was there in that period of time in Scotland.  The story line is excellent and always kept me interested. Am very enthused for the next 8 episodes, and hopefully more to follo"
"OR";"Whoever created it did it backwards so that the sticky side of the letters was facing the sticker side of the paper and therefore required me to remove each letter one by one to apply to the wall. I have gotten a lot of these types of decals for my home, this was made wrong."
"OR";"Believe it or not, after 3 weeks in a house of 4 Jack Russells. This toy is still alive! I have bought similar snakes but they were destroyed in under an hour."
"OR";"I've had the same shoe for more than a year now, and continue to have the desired comfort. I hope they never discontinue this style! Amazon continues to be online choice for everthing."
"OR";"This is my second Eureka Enviro steamer.  My first one died (it was a used one).  It works really well, and I am happy with it."
"OR";"Very nice 100% cotton sheets. I purchase based on listed as ""percale weave"", however packaging has no mention of this.  Will wash and hope they hold up."
"OR";"Price is reasonable not the cheapest but these are sure to work well. Nice and easy to open and close, good quality material too."
"OR";"Eldest cat laid atop it for a day or two, but neither cat show any interest in it. They liked the box it came in though."
"OR";"Beautiful as always. ...do not believe the reviews were they say this is Not the real Swarovski Annual ornament. .because IT IS.  I HAVE COLLECTED THESE SINCE 1992.....WELL PACKAGED AND FAST SHIPPING"
"OR";"They worked well outside during the holidays.  I would have preferred buying Made in America.  Didnt realize they were made in China until they arrived."
"OR";"Rail fit my Ruger 10/22 perfectly. Just put a little of blue loctite and you're good. Mounted my scope with no issues."
"OR";"I really liked the product. fully met expectations.
Many thanks to you guys!
A really good product!
Recommend to everyone!!"
"OR";"A nostalgic series that I missed when I was a teenager because I was in school when it came on TV.  Now I can enjoy it when I've got time on my hands and nothing more important to do."
"OR";"I have just started this book and hope I don't have to read too many graphic autopsy reports.  I didn't read The Surgeon but found I didn't have to as this book so far has made numerous references to it.

It seems most of these stories are written by women and always have female M.E.s doing the auto"
"OR";"Hard to use, and the crayons are really skinny and fall out/break easily. I recommend the egg shaped crayons by crayola that are all crayon with no plastic part if your child is under 2 or the super jumbo sized regular style crayons if your child is over 2."
"OR";"Love the Ludlow Hall Series. Who doesn't love sexy hot alpha men & gorgeous women who steal their hearts."
"OR";"I bought these for camping and hiking. They work well and help retain your body heat and don't require added weight or bulkiness."
"OR";"Ring is awesome and the fit is good! I wanted something I didn't have to take off when I go to the gym and grab the weights, or do some physical labor."
"OR";"The book covers many ways to build and maintain relationships (mostly professional) that would help you build a network like Keith has. I personally wouldn't use many of them but I think everyone will find at least a few that will be useful in their professional life."
"OR";"My only complaint is that they seem to run a little large, especially the length.  For jeans that are supposed to fit below the waist, they end up being a few inches too long."
"OR";"The C/D size is a true wide with no binding or pressure to problem foot areas.  The feel perfect right out of the box with no breaking in."
"OR";"I love these little lights! The walk way and pond are well marked now!! The price is perfect for the size and I will buy more!"
"OR";"super bright beam and tail light. lasted me several hours or more on low beam. lets me see far ahead and close up."
"OR";"my 2 cats enjoy this food as a change from their regular food. it arrived without problem i like the variety and the way its presented"
"OR";"I had first purchased a much smaller bag thinking that I kid meet my needs, but it wasn't even large enough to hold two charging cords.  The depth of this bag allows me to bring all related cords for my three devices with me when I travel."
"OR";"Intrigue, suspense, romance, secrets, and inseparable best friends all add up to an enticing mystery.  And of life changes happen along the way."
"OR";"I did like it at first, but right around the end (where they tie up the loose ends) it drifted down and never came back up for air. Too bad."
"OR";"I'm loving the step taboo stories!! They are so hot and wild! This one was very sexy with the whole masked sexy guy thing then the making out then HELLO it's your step brother. Wow! Do you stop since its so wrong? Or continue since it feels so right?"
"OR";"This was an excellent first novel and I enjoyed reading it.  I hope he writes another also set in Naples.  The West is the Best, Florida-wise!"
"OR";"I purchased this watch for my wife almost two years ago. She wore it very rarely, as a ""vacation watch"" when we went on vacations where we would be swimming or snorkeling. The watch's description on Amazon states: ""Water resistant to 100m (330ft): in general, suitable for swimming and snorkeling, bu"
"OR";"I loved the whole set!  Great reading!  Finished all seven books within a week!!!!  Need more immediately please!  Thank you!!!"
"OR";"Always love 501's. Always fit great just like the originals. And they last for years. Won't buy any others."
"OR";"I liked that I found 3 different sizes of scoops. I use them for a lot of things. Good price, good value."
"OR";"This is my daughter's favorite toy since 11 months. She has just taken her first steps at age 1, but still loves this cart"
"OR";"As always we really enjoyed it! Great family time! Action, comedy, and little sad parts too! Highly recommended..."
"OR";"This shower head is fantastic.  My other shower head was very noisy, and the water flow / coverage was not that great.  The main problem was that you had to reach / feel into the shower to see if the water was warm enough to get into the shower plus it took 1 minute minimum to warm up to a comfortab"
"OR";"I love my DNS-325 so far.  At the moment, I have a single WD 2TB ""Green"" hdd installed.  I like the small footprint, the ease of installation, the web browser interface, and the power savings.  It boots up fast too.  And it's super quiet.

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 70"
"OR";"I think this is my favorite ring ever. It is absolutely amazing. It is so intricate in details and it's so elegant. Wow this is a beauty!! Thank you for the gorgeous gift box too."
"OR";"Finally found a can opener that opens cans simply and easy. What more can I say except that it's well made and sturdy? Nuff said."
"OR";"I am a professed lover of 'chick flicks' and this one is a top ten!!  All the characters are spot-on and very entertaining. Have worn out the VHS version and moving on to the DVD."
"OR";"I'm a fan of blowfish anyway BUT these are my favorite boots ever. True to size. Comfortable. And great for anyone with bigger calfs."
"OR";"Nora Roberts never disappoints! Loved the book, as all of her books are awesome! Must read! Don't miss out! Get it now!"
"OR";"I bought one of these lenses used off of eBay. While it would be nice to have a higher maximum aperture than f4, this lens is ridiculously sharp, and having the full frame equivalent range of 24-105mm is really nice for a lens of the size of a typical kit lens."
"OR";"I am 5' 6"" tall 124 lbs and these fit perfect, great length to cover top of shoe. Soft material and very comfortable. I bought them to wear at fitness class but I can also dress them up for a date with my husband. I also bought a black pair."
"OR";"These goggles work great!  I use them plowing our driveway and road on a quad and they keep my vision clear by blocking the snow and not fogging up."
"OR";"I am on my feet all day so a great fit is mandatory.  These shoes are just what I need and at a great price.  Thank you for carrying small sizes!"
"OR";"Very well made.  Nice lens and large.

Light weight also.  Tongue on the lizard/snake won't come off too easy."
"OR";"I had my local honey stored in a mason jar but it was so messy with the basic ring cap. Every time I tried to get a spoonful it made a mess. This is so much cleaner, and popping it into place in the lid was easy. It looks nice sitting on my counter too."
"OR";"I got this ring as a pinky ring. It fit perfect and looks just the way they said. It is of high quality and will definitely be buying more from here."
"OR";"I enjoyed the book. I have reread it several times. Even though, the editing could have been better, the premise and plot of the story was not comprised. Loved the primary characters. The secondary characters added more flair to the story. Cannot wait for Carlo's story. Keep them coming."
"OR";"Great craftsmenship. Very sharp out of box! I literally closed this and touched it on the inside of my finger and was sliced.  It is a beautiful knife.  I opted for the leather sheath/case and I am really glad I did. I was concerned that the knife would be too small but it's actually the perfect siz"
"OR";"I wasn't a fan of the Star Trek franchise before I saw this movie but I actually really loved it and am super excited for the second one."
"OR";"The author tried to make the mystery/romance novel cute, but I could not really get into the book. Would not really recommend."
"OR";"A film in the atmosphere of Halloween time. The story is good, the intrigue is built well and holds us in suspense till the end."
"OR";"Needed a dress for a spring wedding in Colorado.very comfortable fabric with just the right stretch.  Numerous compliments on the dress and lots of inquiries as to where I found it."
"OR";"Great book... though with a silly ending that reminded me of the antics in ""Tower Heist"" (the 2012 Ben Stiller-Eddie Murphy movie)."
"OR";"I bought this case from a store for my new iPad (3rd gen). While it does fit, it would slip out of the smaller clips on the left side of the case that hold the device every once in awhile. Finally, after having it for only 4 days, one of the clips snapped. So, needless to say I'm looking for a new c"
"OR";"It's a sturdy little boat. My son uses it every bath time plus it has traveled frequently to the public pool and been shared with all the kids in the toddler pool there. We've had it 2 years now and even with all the heavy use, it looks brand new."
"OR";"Smaller than I expected from what I thought I was looking at on the I suggest that a size or liter capacity could be added to the information given in the sales pitch"
"OR";"Here is a good to great documentary on the Roman Empire.  Part of me wishes I lived back then.  But I would have been a slave not a free man as I am today."
"OR";"Love it!  Works perfectly with my Python Mini and my Python Small Tall, primes my siphon without disturbing my tank set up, should've gotten one years ago.  It comes with two ends in the box, the smaller one fits both my siphons."
"OR";"I'm sorry, but most of the stories in here had little or any connection to science fiction.  Some were good, but should have been included in anthologies of other areas of fiction. Most were just long stories."
"OR";"Heartwarming story of survival and love. Well written with dialogue that just flows. Strong lovable characters that you want to read about again and again."
"OR";"I just upgraded my internet to 300mb down and this helps bring in those incredibly fast speeds. Obviously it is easy to set up since it just plugins into the auxiliary cable."
"OR";"A simple to learn risk/reward dice rolling game that is loads of fun. A great edition to any gaming group at a great price."
"OR";"I use this for my Great Pyrenees. It works well and I really like the thicker handle. It helps my hand from tiring out sooner."
"OR";"If it was longer I would have loved it even more and scored it higher. Love the story but the length of the books are slightly annoying (so short)"
"OR";"n my opinion, the image is deceiving. To me, the image looks tapered, which is why I purchased this one over others. It is not tapered it is the basic Mason Jar shape."
"OR";"sturdy, well made, seems to have a good seal. arrived on time and as described. perfect for flour/sugar or any other dry goods."
"OR";"Love this bracelet,but was a little loose on last snap. Cut the excess off because it stuck out. Can tell it will look better the more I wear it."
"OR";"Shirt is awesome. I used this brand before but feels a bit short. I'm 6ft, felt like it was 1-2 inches too short."
"OR";"I found it entertaining and would probably watch it again. I thought Al's character was pretty funny. I just wished it would o ended different."
"OR";"Great quality! Has lasted very well, on my indoor outdoor cat, who gets into everything!
I like that there is an option for adding to the back!"
"OR";"An excellent choice for use as a durable lightweight stand bag for use on the driving range or on the course. Highly recommend this bag."
"OR";"I'm disappointed. 1 bowl has a chipped bottom & 2 bowls have pitted insides.
I would return them for refund but I need these for a dinner."
"OR";"They quit making the Wendy Davis pink ones I had before. I loved them, but they wore out. These fit perfectly and are light. They look nice too."
"OR";"This is a good buy for the money.  Not the top of the line but just under it.  I would recommend these to anyone.  Definitely a good buy and fits perfectly."
"OR";"I have been using frontline for years, but lately doesn't seem to be working for my dogs. After applying, there are still signs of fleas and constant itching."
"OR";"A great sculpt for an action figure and joy for the kids. One always needs some suoper villains for the superheroes to wage battle with."
"OR";"Slightly disappointed with the quality of this sweater overall. I know it is advertised as a V neck but everyone knows the military/police wear crew collars."
"OR";"I like these targets. Helps an old man see what I'm shooting. Peep sites, nice gun = fun

Thanks"
"OR";"Up here in Chicago we are getting a lot of snow and bitter cold. I am forever scraping off the windshield. Because these gloves are waterproof I can almost actually enjoy that job."
"OR";"Did not come with the required adhesive to attach product. Found something around the house that works but disappointed I didn't get what i purchased."
"OR";"This is another great little lego toy that keeps the kids happy for a small price the likes. that I will keep buying."
"OR";"Ed Wood Movies are great and need an award for their cheapness and fun topics they covered -- Long live Ed Wood"
"OR";"a great prequel for the Managing the Boss series...A lead in to Alex Reid's bad boy , playboy ways. Well written and fast paced, it answers several questions you didn't realize you had. Great start to a new series of stories."
"OR";"These will fit on 1/2 inch cage spacing. Very hard to find. Like the clear bottle. Love the Japanese pet supply."
"OR";"I ordered ""Grover"" for my niece for Christmas.  He is her favorite and she loved the gift.  The color is the same exact blue as ""Grover"" on tv and his fur is so soft."
"OR";"Vanilla Sky is a visually and intellectually fascinating film that many viewers and critics found too confusing to enjoy. What starts out as a surreal mystery turns out to be an exploration into the nature of reality. In this way, it is similar to The Matrix, Dark City and some other recent films wh"
"OR";"I don't buy low quality dog food, never have. My Airedale is 2 and 1/2 years old. I started her out on Nutro which was ok, switched to Canidae as I was influenced by dog food purists. Canidae was decent food for an astronomical price. Then I noticed Newmans own organic dog food. I decided to try it "
"OR";"This was a birthday gift. Granddaughter loved it. Perfect for the toddler age. Good and sturdy for small kids and they love the colors."
"OR";"Needed just a little more storage in our bathroom, and decided to put this over a hook on the bathroom door as it was a little heavy, and I wasn't sure the new shower head would hold it. This turned out to be a great holder from my make up and looks very nice. Very sturdy and well made."
"OR";"This book was for a friend . I have never read this book before. She loves the series . She lost her first  5 book , so I replaced them for her"
"OR";"About the Green River killer. I heard of him but never knew any details of the events. This movie filled me in on what a sicko that guy was and the messed up stuff he did to people."
"OR";"sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  They say it's according to how many fleas are around to hop aboard and keep pestering until that they bite the dust.  I guess it's better than not using anything but frustrating to have your pet still scratching and licking (just maybe not as much?)..."
"OR";"Great price!  They were a big hit at my daughter's bday party. They came exactly as described: 4 sheets, so we had plenty to share."
"OR";"Good story.  Easy to follow and see what is happening.  I enjoyed it though not my all time favorite.  Not a bad start to a series."
"OR";"helps keep our 87 yr old aunt happy and satisfied that she can understand the story line good family program"
"OR";"Boring. I felt like I had to finish the book, but it lost my interest early on. The ending was flat. Would not recommend this book."
"OR";"I bought this for my daughter because the last one I bought had too much lent coming off all over her bed. But this blanket is really soft and no lint."
"OR";"these products are from one of the leaders in bicycle products,quite possibly the leader,but their components are topflight high quality,long lasting gear,you won't be disappointed!!!!!!"
"OR";"One ring mount fit the rail, the other didn't without excessive force, but backed it off the rail after a half inch to avoid damage to rail and / or mount ring.  Requesting exchange & hoping for a dual fit on second attempt."
"OR";"This was a Valentine's gift for my wife. She loves Matthew. So the movies were a hit.
4 Stars because the discs come ""stacked"" on top of each other - not separately."
"OR";"Read it in 3 days couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next book and liked the short story in the end."
"OR";"So far so good. I've only worn these twice. I am hoping they last much longer to justify the price. They are a bit tighter than expected."
"OR";"Love these!  The extra lip is a super feature.  Especially love that there are no places where food can build up where handles often attach to the cups."
"OR";"Picked this book when I saw it was recommended on several sites. Completely fell in love!! Great, exciting book for anyone!"
"OR";"Its does a good job sharpening and is reasonably priced. It is superior to diamond sharpeners because the belts can be changed and replaced. I got one for myself and my son-in-law."
"OR";"Great performance , but rear speakers are a little light in sound. Otherwise, a very good buy! Nice, full sound."
"OR";"This is a great read. Jd my heart broke for you. To hold onto secure t s to spare your boys. Jo  what a strong amazing women you are"
"OR";"used these for a bourbon tasting and the size was perfect

guests loved the size and uniqueness"
"OR";"These socks are even cuter than the picture! They shipped fast and the price is really good for the good quality you're getting."
"OR";"after checking all over for the perfect toaster, we found this one. It toasts to each family members likes. Easy to use, toasts large pieces bread.  Plug is in frount , little inconvienent, but can live with it. Amazon had the best price. would recomend this toaster"
"OR";"Another great story by the master story teller. Wish it had been longer. Need a whole series on this marvelous heroin."
"OR";"I broke my filter/silencer off my Craftsman 1.5 gallon air compressor several years back and forgot about it.  I pulled it out a while back and realized this piece was missing so I ordered this one to replace it.  Quieted the compressor right down...I should have got it years ago."
"OR";"I got this for toting my work laptop back and forth, and it is perfect, most especially for the price. There were no noticeable finishing issues.

Nicely made, with decent padding in the straps and back. There is sufficient room for a large laptop, cords and cables, some notebooks, and whatever else"
"OR";"I still prefer the italian version and this recording seemed to drag on f o r e v e r.  Enough said...."
"OR";"Unable to find this size in any stores, medium in the 45 piece package....My dogs teeth are beautiful....no need for doggie dentures...."
"OR";"Lamp works like a champ on all settings. Only thing I didn't like is the shade is HUGE. Seems large for the body of the lamp."
"OR";"The connector on the enclosure seems like it won't last very long and isn't very secure.  It would work well enough if I'm using it at a desk where I'm not moving around much, but I doubt it would work well using my laptop at an airport."
"OR";"Not everyone ones wants or finds a electronic dictionary handy!!  Thank goodness they still make some in print.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!"
"OR";"I am using these to power my camcorder.  They are effective on a fresh charge, but after they sit a while you better charge them again if you anticipate needing them.  If they do have a full charge on them, they last a long time. Charging them is a breeze.  I have not used the car charger accessory "
"OR";"I turned the dining room into my sons bedroom and to give him a little privacy i bought some burlap and this curtain rod works perfectly."
"OR";"This is a great menorah depending on what your needs are.  Traveling during Hanukkah? This will fit perfectly in your suitcase and will be great in a hotel.  Small living space? Perfect size.  Obviously this is not going to be an heirloom quality piece, but in a pinch it's perfect!  Standard birthda"
"OR";"Disappointed.  It would not split some logs I could split with a maul.  The motor takes a couple seconds to spool up for each stroke, which is annoying.  The design requiring both hands to engage probably keeps some lawyer happy somewhere but is very clumsy to operate."
"OR";"Nice headgear on headlamp, but it seems as though headlamp use's a lot of batteries,and for the price I expected a little better light."
"OR";"It is often hard to find over sized beach towels. As soon as I came across this one I knew I had to have it. I love the flower design and it has the most vibrant colors. I would definitely recommend this towel to anyone that is a serious beach/pool person. You won't be disappointed."
"OR";"Used for my cat when she had an infected paw, as well as for her spay surgery. Much better deal than purchasing from the vet or pet store."
"OR";"Very cute and lightweight. The only reason I gave 4 stars is I am afraid if they a rent kept in a case they will break easily (they have not broken yet!)"
"OR";"I originally got this for dog walking. It fits my massive iPhone 6+ in a Lifeproof case, headphones, doggy bags, and keys. Since its wider than most belts it's very roomy and I think I'm going to use it when traveling. A small money clip could hold cards and ID, leaving your valuables safe and your "
"OR";"I used to just use a plastic bag to pick up the dog poop in my backyard, but it was killing my back. I went ahead and bought this about 6 months ago and will never go back. The product works great even with the tall grass, highly recommend!"
"OR";"We needed a new light for our hunter fan.  This one fits perfectly and gives the amount of light we need.  Love it."
"OR";"They fit as expected when you first put them on but they stretch out soon after they are playing and moving. Then they look baggy and stretched out, mostly the pants. And the shirts are a little short. Cute colors true to the picture. They just don't hold their shape like the other carter's ones I b"
"OR";"I love bamboo.  I am picky about what goes into my kitchen or, as in this case, what I give to someone else for their kitchen.  I read all the reviews (on Amazon and on other sites) about Joyce Chen and took a chance.  Big mistake.  Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I wo"
"OR";"We carry this with us whenever we take the pup in the car. Great feeling that he can satisfy his thirst away from home. Works just fine."
"OR";"We've used this for our previous dogs and now for our new ones.  They like the taste and I feel good about giving them great nutrition."
"OR";"Just received this yesterday and tried the recipe that came with it today. Easy and delicious. Pan cleaned up almost by itself. I highly recommend this product."
"OR";"This book is awesome!! I would recommend this book for any and everybody to read. For this to be her first book, I think that she did a great job. Karma was a handful and I can't wait for part two. King is Bae!!! You did Great Azari!!!! I couldn't put this book down no matter how hard I tried."
"OR";"why doesn't control the swing set? I bought one and my air keep cycling every minute or so....Cycling will destroy the compressor"
"OR";"something like %400 cheaper than a store, including shipping. they fit right in to my 5mW laser and so far working perfectly."
"OR";"Leaks very easily and quickly if the cap is not turned close. This is a problem as my kids can't close it on their own. so it results in soaked car seats and other accidents."
"OR";"This product was a disappointment. I was surprised by how light the box was. I couldn't understand until I opened it. The inside of the bean bag chair seems to be a form of styrofoam shipping peanuts. The outside of the bag is not much better - very low quality ""suede"". Not worth the money."
"OR";"Pretty cool  small Bluetooth speaker with a built-in clip
 it sounds good - louder than I expected
No connection problem I recommend"
"OR";"My two cats love to play.  They love this cat toy.  My older cat has even learned how to turn it on by watching me."
"OR";"My son is 3.  This is a great set to learn how to do these types of puzzles.

Each puzzle is labeled with a different shape on the back for easy sorting."
"OR";"Replaced a convention KEY lock with this to keep out would be technicians that use a screwdriver to force the lock.  This is a little more difficult to hack :)"
"OR";"dont like the fit and it is heavy, feels like elderly ear rings on my ear...works good but try wearing it"
"OR";"This works really well, can change between grams, oz etc and it can be tared too.  The battery life is excellent, I haven't had to change it yet."
"OR";"My son wanted a fish theme for his room so it hard to find sheet that are boyish these were perfect with the little sharks. Also they are very Soft Sheets!! I have washed them 2 times now and still very soft to the touch almost softer then some of my more exspensive sheet sets I have."
"OR";"Nice square, a lot of info on it, but lacks the 1/12 markings and no hole to hang. Very light and easy to handle. Hope it is sturdy."
"OR";"Great product, Used it everyday from about 7 months with no problem. NOTE: it may not be as effective on measurements of less than 5 inches.."
"OR";"I bought these for my son and he loves them. If they have one downside, it is the fact that the cardboard coukld be a little thicker to add strength to the product."
"OR";"An amazing story. You are carried right along with the characters. Experiencing every emotion with them. You laugh, cry, get upset etc.....  It is very, very realistic. Getting ready for the next installment.  I received this book from eBook Discovery in exchange for an honest review."
"OR";"From Boy to super star everything you need to know about Justin Bieber it's as the cover say the ultimate Bieber fan book."
"OR";"Love the glasses!  Great for ice tea or just water. easy to hold even for arthritic hands because of the small bottom."
"OR";"I like this DVD.  It is not extremely challenging but I have seen results using it.  I have used other Crunch DVDs in the past and that is what prompted me to try this one."
"OR";"By far the best expanse novella I've read to date. It does a great job explaining Amos' background and how he ended up in space"
"OR";"First time Cold Steel Purchase. Where have they been all my life? Strong, sharp, great grip, easy to deploy.
I am a fan!"
"OR";"Terrific drop-in solution for my track-lighting fixtures.  The lights are bright and dimmable (no buzzing or flickering!).  Very warm, pleasing warm light color."
"OR";"Out Lab mix loves chasing these.  We use the ""Chuck It"" launcher and throw the balls pretty far! These are durable and fly well!"
"OR";"Out of Frame is the third In Focus book that I've read and I really liked it!  The story is told in first person from the perspective of both main characters, Jay and Quinn. I always enjoy first person, and while this is a great way to get into the heads of both guys without resorting to third perso"
"OR";"K. Elliott is my new favorite author have read all of these books and can't put them down. Look forward to the next one."
"OR";"The size and look of it does make people look twice. Soft and cuddly to the touch too. I got him for my grandson, because he isn't allowed to touch our real Pomeranian, and the way he grabs plush ""Buddy"" and bites his nose, that's probably a good rule."
"OR";"I've had one of these for years and I want to get at least one more.  I haven't been able to find them in home improvement stores lately.  You can mount this clamp anywhere on your work bench by simply drilling a hole for the supplied round headed bolt and then countersinking for the bolt head.  Whe"
"OR";"I very much enjoyed Mr. Chisholm's take on the Meryton Ball where Elizabeth and Darcy first meet.  Gotta read."
"OR";"By far the best MTB purchase I've made all year! Ever since i rode my buddy's Cannondale Jekyll with his Rockshox Reverb dropper post, I've always wanted one of my own. With most dropper posts running around $300+ i could not really afford/justify buying one, being that my bike was only around $900."
"OR";"My Pekinese wasn't too happy after the 3rd bark.  Shut him down really fast.  So he's good for 2 barks and knows what happens after the 3rd."
"OR";"my marauder loves these pels. clean one hole shot after shot.
may be a little heavy for a regular springer rifle"
"OR";"I got the sneakers on time. I was a little apprehensive of the size I chose {10.5} and thought I would have to send it back. The size was a perfect fit and I like the design. I bought this shoes for cross-training even though they are runners. They are very comfortable and lightweight. Very satisfie"
"OR";"You know what I loved about this book?  I never had to forgive the hero or the heroine for being an idiot.  Not once did they betray each other. Not once did they fail to forgive a shortcoming.  There was no subterfuge, no great misunderstanding.  It's just a story of a man, trying to win a woman's "
"OR";"I have been wearing this line of sports bras for more than 10 years.  they have good bounce control, provide shaping, and have nice cushioning for no show-through."
"OR";"Was difficult to read, at times. TMI. Anyone who likes fashion/designers could find it interesting. History of department stores is included"
"OR";"The tp-link classic remote switch that works with Alexa. They work fine once configured. Only thing I don't like is to configure them, you have to run their app on iOS or Android.  None exists for Windows so if you don't have one of these smart phones, stay away"
"OR";"Carefully packed.  Beautiful piece that looks ten times more expensive than the price paid. Plenty of capacity for larger watches."
"OR";"Santa brought this gift and my daughter refuses to put her down the hair is so soft. This baby doll really is just the prettiest little thing"
"OR";"Can't wait to read the rest of the series this book was awesome the characters i love storyline awesome couldn't put it down"
"OR";"I stumbled upon this series and really enjoyed the couple of books I've read. Can't wait to read about some of the other characters!"
"OR";"Another Great story and one step closer for me to completing the ""Impossible Collection"" Much appreciated to you for Carrying the Classic Doctor Who!"
"OR";"Love Layla and Harris, even more so together, hot, insatiable, and action packed.  Can't wait for more Alpha One Security ."
"OR";"I liked this set so well I bought another one just to get the canning funnel.  Works very well to help with canning."
"OR";"This is a very high-quality beautiful doll.  Everything about her is upgrade from the average Barbie doll.  The eyelashes really add a lot, as do the upscale clothing and shoes."
"OR";"I use it for my small window fan. The sound is not exactly quiet and I wish there was a switch off/on. You need to pull it out from the socket to start/stop."
"OR";"The Nagura stone is necessary to keep you fine grit stones to work properly. It creates the cream that you need to sharpen your blades properly."
"OR";"I received two heart penguins and no circle penguin.  Disappointing as we are also using these to study our shapes.  Otherwise as a toy themselves they are nice."
"OR";"Very goid movie.. Andy is a drunk and a singer with a loud mouth.. never seen him like this before.. a must watch for Andy fans"
"OR";"This product keeps your blades & discs safe and clean when not in use.  I would not have ordered a food processor that did not have this available.  The only con is that the bottom is open - so you have to be careful if you pick up the box.  Just be aware of this and watch young would-be cooks aroun"
"OR";"A gripping tale about space exploration, the risk it entails, and the emotions involved.  It will make you look at deep space exploration in a new light."
"OR";"This cable combined with Leviton plugs makes an extension cord that has no equal. I will never again buy regular extension cords for outdoor use."
"OR";"They get the job done. Nice bright color. Be sure to pay attention to the dimensions. Much smaller than I expected, but that was my fault."
"OR";"Great simple desk! Super easy to assemble. Packaged really well, arrive way quicker than expected (two days, max).
I took away one star because you don't get to use all of the drawer, it doesn't pull out all of the way."
"OR";"I am glad I watched it - it was good, clean fun.  Shows that movies CAN be made without bad language and still be good!"
"OR";"I have two of these for my Dachshunds. Dachshunds can be hard to fit due to their super deep chest and tapered neck, but these harnesses fit great. The harnesses are durable, easy to clean (throw them in the washer), are made of good materials, and are expertly made. Very good quality."
"OR";"This is high quality grain free dog food.  It will makes your dog's coat shine.  It's not a cheap food with a lot of fillers."
"OR";"This is one I hope never ends! The author is gifted, her stories come to life and they've managed to take over mine lately!"
"OR";"I use this for single-point slings.  It fits snug and has a good finish.  It has stops to keep it from twisting but can be rotated so it can minimize bunching the nylon."
"OR";"Love the chair. It is a great price and very comfortable. This chair is great for folks with a large bottom ans it is very roomy. The only reason is it not 5 stars is that on soft ground the legs will sink a little. It would of been better if the legs were a curved one piece design."
"OR";"In the tradition of The Handmaids Tale this book talks to what can happen when religiosity runs amok...  I love the foundational premise... the aspects of struggles with faith when suddenly you are one of the sinners...

The book however drags and gets lost in details....

A great book to skim"
"OR";"I was very surprised by this. It's very sturdy and the quality seems to be better than you would expect for something you paid $14 for. My husband blew it up with his mouth and had no issue. My kids have bounced both indoors and out and its neither showing any signs of wear and tear, nor is it filth"
"OR";"Unlike other similar signs, this one is of excellent indoor/outdoor quality.  The rugged look is perfect for our son-in-law's Colorado hunting cabin.  I really cannot wait to give it to him on his birthday...in fact, he may get it tonight!  Any hunter would love to display this!  Thank you!"
"OR";"This is wonderful for the backseat of our Chevy Cruze and two Toy Fox Terriers. The price is much better than the Snoozer brand I have in our CRV."
"OR";"Read along with # 10 last week,have since read #11, & 12 last weekend and currently reading #13."
"OR";"Works fine for my gate. I like it a lot more than the MasterLock of the same style, which I regrettably also bought. I would buy this product again."
"OR";"Love all three titles in this series. If you are already a fan of Roberts, it won't disappoint. If you aren't a fan you will be. Narrator does a nice job."
"OR";"This movie doesn't stop, its action, action, action through the whole thing.  If you love disaster themes then this is for you.  Dwayne Johnson is super, (and easy on the eyes).  The CG images are spectacular and believable. I almost hated when it ended, but the great thing is I can watch it over an"
"OR";"A well told tale of ""what if."" What if the Germans defeated GB in WWII; what would the  occupation be like; how would the resistance emerge. But its Deighton & there's much more including a wonderfully constructed plotline that captures the imaginary infighting among the victors."
"OR";"Entertaining ang brimming with successful alternative, organic farming alternatives. I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks ""organic"" only means expensive."
"OR";"Absolutely nothing wrong with the visor  just a little wider on the brim then I would have liked but still a great buy for the price"
"OR";"Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enou"
"OR";"Stone fell glued it back on looks nice feels cheap but can't complain price seemed almost fair"
"OR";"The Hot Corn Dip is especially good. Made this for a Super Bowl party this year and everyone raved about it. The group decided that it should be come a staple at future Super Bowl events! Of course, there are MANY other tasty recipes in the book as well."
"OR";"Great product.  Saves time, trip, and money from standing in line at Petco.  I and others I know will be back to order more."
"OR";"Love the skillet but so disappointed. I've been waiting for this to arrive and it has a big gash right out of the box! Now have to endure the returning and replacing hassle."
"OR";"Quality done fantasy fashion doll with collector quality packaging that will inspire the young and young at heart. All with a not to pinch your wallet pricing."
"OR";"Each of them are running from their pastor history.  Alpha son/street muscian, daughter of wanna be an alpha's (any alpha's) mate mother meet.  The attraction is there.  Can they support each other and realize that the history they are running from doesn't have to be theirs?  Facing up to grow up ma"
"OR";"Fun little snowboard to use in the backyard or local hill. Small kid sized and easy for them to get in and out of the boot straps. Only downside is: it's boring looking. Kids want graphics/colors/decals/etc. Lucky Bums make ones that look way better !"
"OR";"Have had them a month and so far they are great!  I think if they had constant wear and tear they might get run down, but we only use them occasionally and they are great for that."
"OR";"Great light for the small utility room I installed it in. Simple to install, too. Hoping that 10 years from now I will be able to attest to its longevity!"
"OR";"If I had realized how short it was I wouldn't have Dow loaded it .subject matter ok except they had been toooo long not to know what she wanted for the anniversary gift"
"OR";"New Era hats are my favorite fitted baseball gats. I have had 4 hats from them. Over time, they get dirty, but I still like them."
"OR";"My Yorkies love it! And, I love it because it is so light! No weight to it at all. My 'girls' needed that extra step to get up on my pillow top bed."
"OR";"Unfortunately all the bandages are way too small to treat a moderate size wound. I had to go to pharmacy to buy something bigger anyway."
"OR";"I tried a few of these to keep around as extras if I lose my good one or is I have people training with me that didn't bring gear. Pretty thin and flimsy, also quite small. OK enough for a temp or for weightlifting but not something I would want to spar hard with at all."
"OR";"Love these cute shoes! Well made for the price, good fit. Woven upper, rubber bottom. Comfy."
"OR";"This Diary of a Wimpy Kid book is funny and child can relate to some of the situations this kid talks about.  Child enjoys reading these books."
"OR";"I've absolutely loved this series! Get them at your library;  buy them at your retail store; or get them on your Kindle!  You will so enjoy them;  I certainly have!"
"OR";"We ordered these for our garage to hang our bikes on. They are sturdy and hold the bikes perfectly. We have five bikes hanging and these saved us a ton of space."
"OR";"This is an awesome shirt! I purchased this for my husband in the black and I have to say it is one of my very favorites in his wardrobe. We live in So. California where it is virtually always warm and my husband literally lives in shorts & tee's year round. He needs many shirts & shorts so I stay on"
"OR";"Home automation seems to be one of the biggest raves talked about in today's electronic industry. Unfortunately, it has not yet reached a point where it is affordable enough for people on limited budgets. Enter this magnificent product. This product comes with the three receivers and one remote. The"
"OR";"The cousins trilogy was enjoyable and I am glad I read it. There some amusing malaprops, however, including 'fluke' instead of 'champagne flute,' 'exhume' vs 'exude,' 'imply' vs 'implicate' and 'anguish' instead of 'languish. '  My favorites are the first two."
"OR";"Excellent quality gloves! These fit both mine and my husbands hands comfortably and securely thanks to the Velcro wrist closure. We use these a few times a week with our punching bag and they've held up very nicely. No rips or tears and they have a good amount of padding."
"OR";"I bought this for my GSD who has an issue with mites when he is stressed.  This keeps the mites under control.  He hasn't ha an issue since I started using this."
"OR";"""It's A fire alarm"" After installing I had no problem getting them to connect. A little tricky to set up but after a few tries I succeeded.
They are very load and this is a good thing."
"OR";"I just wish the king sizes would be a little bit wider but that is the way they make them.  The picture shows the spread almost touching the floor but my bed is higher so it doesn't come down that far.  Other then that I love it.  It is not very heavy so taking it off at night is easy and not a hass"
"OR";"Book 2 of the series starts 3 months after the first book ended. Jenna and her five year old daughter are trying to live a normal life away from Lilly's father who happens to be a crime boss of the London mob. Jenna and Lilly barely escaped death at her father's Cornwall property. So Jenna wants to "
"OR";"This wedding ring set arrived very quickly.  It really is a very nice set at a very reasonable cost.  It arrived in a very beautiful black velvet ring box.  I would not plan to wear this as an everyday ring set, since it is not a full white gold, just white gold plated, I would not expect it to hold"
"OR";"Use a lower heat setting and let the aluminum heat up while moving it around over the heat source in order to cook your waffle evenly."
"OR";"Does not have the ""soft"" feel of a leather case - but it is what it is.  Perfect fit - protects the kindle - and easy to handle.  Very sturdy and looks good."
"OR";"I got this for our orange tabby male cat, but he looks adorable in it.  The bell is great because he is FAST and gets under our feet quickly, so I wanted to know he was coming our way.  The colors and flowers really look great with his orange stripes and white face and feet."
"OR";"I loved every part of this story. It was entertaining, creative, had a dry sense of humor that I very much appreciate, and had the perfect ending. I found myself chuckling more than once. Great great story. Mr. Fry is quickly moving to the top of my favorite indie author list."
"OR";"I am loving these, they are great quality; nice and thick, perfect for doing dishes. I use thinner longer towles for my hand towels."
"OR";"This book has it all!  The subtitle states that it is a ""A Police Romance"" which it is, but it is so much more.  If you want to laugh, cheer, and fall in love read this book."
"OR";"Enjoyed the Venetian scenery.  The movie was eerie and has a rather shocking ending.  It was great to see Sutherland and Christie  in their hey day."
"OR";"Arrived in great condition and quicker than expected (I live in New Zealand). It is exactly what I expected - a book of quotes from spiritual and other world leaders to use as inspiration each day or whenever you wish. The size of the book is excellent and being small, it means I can carry it with m"
"OR";"The only brand I will feed my pure breed Siberian :) He has a sensitive tummy, and I feel the Instinct with probiotics really helped him no longer have loose stools."
"OR";"Sound can be annoying loud, but my son absolutely loves this toy!!! He loves playing with it anywhere and I love the glee on his face! :)"
"OR";"nice for my 12 yo daughter's everyday use for school to match with her wardrobe. not so fascinated but my daughter liked all of it so i gave it a 4star."
"OR";"I love these shoes!  Hope that when the leather stretches & softens they will be the perfect all day shoes!  Great support - really great!!"
"OR";"I can't believe how strong the magnets are on these things... I did not expect to put things like a 16 oz hammer on it and have it stay attached. I purchased 8 of these and will be buying more. If you want your tools at your finger tips or anything else made of metal, these are a must have!"
"OR";"We used this on top of my husbands dresser. Our DVD player and cable box fit perfectly underneath. Downside is that now that we don't have a cable box, and just our slimline DVD/Blu-ray player, we don't need the height of the shelf but the silver posts are not adjustable in size."
"OR";"Didn't like it as much as the first two. Found the story a little frustrating at times, but if your invested in the series you have to read it."
"OR";"The stuffing moves to the path of least resistance. So if you sleep in the middle, soon the foam will move away from your head and you end up in a ""hole"". If you like scooping and molding the stuffing throughout the night to ensure you have the proper neck support, go for it."
"OR";"This book was delightful!  I love time travel books and that it's centered in New York City made me enjoy it even more."
"OR";"Another excellent piece of fiction that could certainly be true.
Cal and fellow warriors triumph again.
Eagerly awaiting next adventure."
"OR";"Love this ball head.  This is the third one I own now.  Little to no creep even with heavy lenses like the Tam-Zooka 150-600mm."
"OR";"For this price it solid. you get tons of the bells and whistles you can not get with this care for the price range. It stays very cool and it very solid case."
"OR";"I fell in love with James ""Gator"" McNeal as he and his staff of detectives untangle the web of jealously, betrayal and murder of a State Senator in the French Quarter. Who doesn't love New Orleans?  Gator is the son of a Irishman and a beautiful Cajun woman and the lead detective when the body of  S"
"OR";"Great starter set for my son. Easy to use tools and great color assortment for a starter set. My only complaint is the set of 3 plastic molds has 2 of the same casts. So instead of having 24 different shapes to mold, we actually have 16...."
"OR";"Wow loved the book. It has you choosing between two loves. Finding who you were and who you are and who you want to be. A very good book you need to read it!"
"OR";"Works well.  Long length occasionally awkward.  Bottom needs to be anchored in order to apply more pressure to the grating surface."
"OR";"Who doesnt like a good movie with a good looking actor.? The women do! So watch away it definitely does not hurt the
eyes."
"OR";"These are good enough, however, there is not a red.  For 50 colors you would think a red would be included.  Most colors are pastel in nature."
"OR";"I have not yet seen the movie, but the book is definitely a good read. There are a few boring parts, but I suggest this to anyone, especially those in sales."
"OR";"Works great on the router table, very well made, all hardware included, I like Jessem products,hats off to our neighbors to the north!!"
"OR";"A friend of mine told me about these so I am trying to train my 4 month old puppy to use them.  The instructions were very clear and I am hopeful she will learn to do this."
"OR";"I am a black and white doggie and this collar accents my coat beautifully. The clip is easy for ""what's-her-name"" to put it on and take it off (my minions are so-o-o-o clumsy)"
"OR";"Great addition to series. I am looking forward to next book in series!  It was very enthralling and enjoyable....stayed up way too late to finish!!"
"OR";"Excellent unit. Much better than the original. Charges quickly and efficiently.  Glad I found this unit online. So far so good"
"OR";"It was good while it lasted. Perfect fit, worked in our Nikon charger. But after a year and a half it would not take a charge and we had to replace it."
"OR";"These are made for small ears only! Like a child's ears. Unless you have small ears as an adult, you'll have difficulty securely placing these on. Avoid purchasing them, unless you discover some way to make them fit your ears better... that doesn't result in damaging them."
"OR";"These fit great and are very comfortable to wear. The price is also pretty amazing. Time will tell if they hold up and I will update accordingly."
"OR";"This is a great set. The only part missing is the 40th anniversary. Maybe next time.
Let's hope in a future set called ""Frank Sinatra around the world"" with Egypt, Israel, Brazil etc. concerts.
Even the price is incredible."
"OR";"This is a classic movie for me.  My family and I watched this movie and reminisced about the old days.  This is a good wholesome movie to watch with the family."
"OR";"Great deal for the price. These provide lots of light and the fixture looks and feels like a high quality product."
"OR";"Excellent book I recommend to everyone who likes Jackie Collins.  If you want a novel that holds your interest read this one."
"OR";"This fits perfectly in my anole's 10 gallon tank.  I piled it up to create hiding spots and fill half the tank.  Leaves plenty of room and space to add other items.  My anole can climb on it without distorting or crushing down the leaves/stems."
"OR";"Classic, doesn;t get better the an oldschool toys. Worth the money to collect or give to the next  generation of turtle lovers!"
"OR";"Excellent product. Not real loud and very good quality. Does well for our Malti Poo. Gets hot FAST though"
"OR";"Best brush we've used on our pitbull. The first time we brushed her, it almost looked like a second dog."
"OR";"This is a really funny movie too. I like the fact that she sings in this movie too. Bette & Lily make a great comedic pair!"
"OR";"Great fun and entertaining book!  Nothing heavy just a fast moving regency romance.  Good for relaxing and laughing."
"OR";"Most history buff film lovers; especially WW II genre folks will enjoy this action movie based on true facts.  Story is one of the saddest in the war....for if perpetrators could have killed Hitler, so many would have been saved."
"OR";"A paranormal story different tan any others I have read.  I quickly got pulled into the story and can't wait to read more."
"OR";"It is a very classy set! Just like the picture. I love that it's machine washable, though haven't washed it yet. The comforter is not too heavy and thick."
"OR";"Works great.  I have wanted an angle grinder for a while now, and our concrete sidewalk project helped make it so.  Highly recommend, especially since it comes with a case.  The way I figure... The best way to keep your tools clean is to put them in the case before you store them away!"
"OR";"It is very entertaining and has a wonderful message at the end. It has a great wild west ending. I have watched it several times... Good adult entertainment."
"OR";"Bought these to go with other gift for oldest Great-Granddaughter's Christmas present. They are adorable !!  The winged ones are small but I know she will love them."
"OR";"A great band that looks better in real life than it does in the photos.  Really upgrades the appearance of the Blaze.  Highly recommended."
"OR";"My kittens liked it but it's not very padded and they've outgrown it quickly. It's ok. Great for kittens. Just wish it was more padded. Carpet is better I think."
"OR";"These targets are easy to see from a distance.  These targets are only 6"" in diameter, so these targets are great for rifles with scopes are close range pistol shooting."
"OR";"I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point for anyone. If you get here, it is because you have enjoyed this and several other related storylines. Start at the beginning and enjoy the adventure!"
"OR";"Nice and flexible.  At a reasonable price too.  I needed different size lugs than what they supply.  A quick email to the seller and I got exactly what I needed.  If you do need a different size lug, submit your change request pretty quickly because this will be shipped out before you blink."
"OR";"No words will ever do this book justice, but I will try. This series is officially my new favorite series-and I have read A LOT. It is the greatest love story I have ever read. Kingsley, Soren and Nora have so much love, trust and devotion for each other. It may not be typical, and you really need a"
"OR";"LOVE this back pack. I've already recommended to a friend and he's bought one too! Really like this setup!"
"OR";"Competitive swim suits fit small. They are supposed to. It's to reduce drag in the water. Be aware that this is not a suit or someone who is looking for something to lounge next to the pool in. With that being said, I love it! And it's held up well during my 3-4 day a week pool workouts."
"OR";"Nice post Valentine's Day treat! Enjoyable short story. Rosalinda was a woman who knew what she wanted. I was hoping Trevor would've been slightly more aggressive but I get the feeling this was just the tip of the iceberg. Nice Den of Sin teaser Ms."
"OR";"Quick shipping!

Minus 1 because it doesn't blend ice like a Ninja, but it is awesome none the less.  Once you master your favorite drink or smoothie you will truly appreciate its stainless steel construction. Keeps it chill, real chill."
"OR";"First time reading this author's work.  A quick plot with plenty of action! I look forward to reading more from this author!"
"OR";"This book was pretty good. I love the suspense this book has it really kept me engaged to finish it in one night. Love the ending as well, looking forward to reading the next book the cliffhanger has me VERY curious!

**This product was received at a discount in exchange for an honest review!**"
"OR";"Ordered a medium for my 33 inch waist. It was too big, I poked extra holes but I love the way it looks and that it doesn't hang."
"OR";"The adjuster works ok but sometimes it's difficult to get it to lock down properly. When it locks properly this is a really easy to use wrench and it's a good physical size making it pretty easy to get into most tight spots (as much as expected with a large wrench)."
"OR";"SEEMS TO WORK GOOD AFTER SOME MESSING AROUND WITH IT
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BETTER INFO AND TROUBLE SHOOTING WITH PRODUCT"
"OR";"Bought these when i received an ice cream maker for Christmas. Love these containers to transport my homemade ice cream to go with any dessert i bring."
"OR";"I own several Hibben products, but this one is by far the prettiest blade, its knife porn, the blade is a work of art and the handle deserves an Oscar! get my drift it is real purdy, but will it stand up to what it is made for? Yes and no, keep the work for this knife to light to medium work, skinni"
"OR";"I purchased this for an indoor basement door to allow my cat to go down as needed. It's a solid item, swinging door works just as described. I personally needed help installing this door because I need a jig saw to cut a hole. After that, it was very easy to install."
"OR";"I'm sure these are great for some dogs, they just didn't work with my pup.  I'll just need to continue to pucker up and whistle as that is what he reacts to!"
"OR";"Even better because rooted in historical fact and a real lust for science.  But better than some other MC books was the richness and depth of the characters, their experiences and context.  I got lost in this book. An excellent read!  Thanks to the family for bringing this terrific story to life."
"OR";"A great bowl, very skid resistant.  Picture is misleading as two bowls are pictured even though you only get one bowl."
"OR";"My granddaughter laughs throughout the reading of this book. Her oft-repeated challenge to me - ""Get it, Gramma?"" Yes, I get it, now keep reading."
"OR";"Great product!
It is highly reliable, durable! And affordable prices touched my heart!
I would recommend this product to a friend!"
"OR";"None of my 3 cats likes these Lysine supplement chews. They are definitely NOT soft and need to be broken up into smaller pieces. I threw the product away and will stick with the Lysine gel and an empty syringe (just ask your pharmacist for one...they're usually free)."
"OR";"Le Creuset - what can I say - You get what you pay for!  I love all of my pieces and understand the price.  Buy one piece and you will want more."
"OR";"It was an old picture which I never saw, so I was happy to get a copy of this film.  I was even surprised it was an Alfred Hitchcock productiob,  jhirsch"
"OR";"This is perfect to get press the liquid out of tofu. I love this thing. No more wasting lots of paper towels or putting something heavy on to the brick of tofu. You will have to tighten the screws for another 10 minutes after the First 15 mins. This press is amazing!"
"OR";"I am using the box to store accessories for a hobby and not for tools.  The size was just what I wanted and the price was right.  I find the box to be well made.  The lid aligns nicely with the base when you close it so the latches work perfectly every time.  Overall I recommend this box."
"OR";"Great purchase! No mess! Works perfect. Our pup has a beautiful coat! Vet recommended to brush him daily and his coat is very shiny."
"OR";"Very good book I really enjoyed it. It is full of surprises. Every one should receive a standing ovation at least once in their life"
"OR";"I purchased new cookware and needed protection; the really work great. Also good for separating glass bowls."
"OR";"This cable is in two parts.  the first is a mini display port that plugs into you Mac Book Pro computer and the output is to an HDMI.  I carry this in my laptop bag.  Whenever I need to show what i'm doing, I can plug it in and show it to any one with an HDMI monitor."
"OR";"This was a gift (I knew my neighbor wanted it), so I can't say for sure. My husband helped with the installation and it worked fine, so I'm assuming everything was as expected. Hard to rate something like a cable. What can I say? It looked perfectly stable, like a cable!"
"OR";"Although The Two Towers is my personal favorite, Peter Jackson doesn't let us down with the third and final installment of this grand trilogy. If the last 45 minutes of this film doesn't grab you emotionally then nothing on film ever will."
"OR";"Installed easily and fit perfectly as a replacement to an older/cheaper fixture.  Looks great and hasn't had any trouble.  Great buy."
"OR";"the outcome was not what I was anticipating...Overall, it was pretty darn good!  If you like to try and figure out the plot and the outcome this one will give you a run for your money :)"
"OR";"I think I own about 10 pair of Cushe shoes, probably more. They are about the only brand of casual shoes I wear. I happened to find some by accident, and it took all of about 2 hours to break them in and for them to mold perfectly to my foot. Cushe shoes are the ultimate comfort and support. My feet"
"OR";"scratchy sound on both movies. tape hiss and pops on both. good old movies. picture quality is good on both movies"
"OR";"In a couple years these will be two for a dollar at your local flea market.  The toys are well made but very very overpriced.  I would suggest waiting for the flea market.

Sad part is the folks at minecraft could sell them for that and still profit hand over fist..."
"OR";"Great deal.  Kind of light weight material, so they didn't last as long as I had hoped, but was well worth the price."
"OR";"These are great to keep in your purse or car or backpack so that you're never without a bag. They're sturdy and a good size."
"OR";"These are fantastic!! We've been able to DRASTICALLY reduce the amount of space our almost 100 Blu rays take up in our entertainment center. I HIGHLY recommend it, especially for those living in small spaces (like myself)!!! They shipped fast and appear to be good quality too."
"OR";"If you want the traditional happily ever after, this is one! No the traditional kind but through all the trials and issues they knew they loved  each other enough to make it work."
"OR";"I do not say this lightly. This set is absolute garbage. I realize these items are supposed to break but the legs will not even stay attached to the table and one the chairs fell apart as well. My daughter opened this last night and most of it is ready to be thrown out this morning."
"OR";"Nicely written and a very enjoyable read.  I love military men so Austin was hot.  Can't wait for the next book."
"OR";"Arrived ahead of schedule.  Great value.  Good quality, but at least 2 sizes too big.  I wear a size L which is what I ordered and received, though it fits like an XXL.  Maybe if I wash it on HOT and dry it in a volcano it'll fit."
"OR";"My great-niece loves this and I highly recommend it for fun, educational experience. She and I recommend it. Great price. Quick shipping. Thank you."
"OR";"My Shih Tzu Mia absolutey loves these ! She has been having 1 every night before bed for at least a few years now.
On the few occassions we mistaenly run out, or can't find them, she gets depressed. It's awesome to be able to order them online
in the event we cant find them locally !"
"OR";"I enjoyed this even better than her other books.  It sure made me realize how much Nigerian history I had forgotten.  Well done."
"OR";"VERY cute set.  Looks just like in the pictures.  Came banged up on two of the corners, but this was a gift for a 6 year old with a young brother, so they may do worse damage.  She can fit all of her ""makeup"" and girlie items in the drawer and on top.  She loved it!  Very easy to assemble."
"OR";"What a delightful story..... and part of a series..... I have a feeling I will read them all.  I have researched her books and put the titles in order and am thrilled to have found another author who writes such endearing tales.  I would put her right up there with Patrick Taylor and his Irish Count"
"OR";"They are the best for mixing, storing etc.,  I haven't tried them in the oven yet.  I wish the lids fit more snug, but, they're great."
"OR";"Topeak makes the best bike accessories and in this case, they have upheld their quality and workmanship. This modular design is genius and it has everything an enthusiast can ever ask for. Never leave home without it. Useful for random chores around the house as well."
"OR";"You're paying for quality here and at that T6 size you better have a good driver. No stripped screws if using the right tool!"
"OR";"I've been very happy with these canteens. I have a filter that I used for long, multi-day hikes, but it only came with a bag that was 16 ounces. These bags are the same gauge as the filter, and they are much larger that the bag that came with it. This helps me have more confidence in my supply of wa"
"OR";"Good quality shin guards but I find myself having to adjust them frequently. no matter how tight the straps are, they want to slip to the side after kicks"
"OR";"I needed a gift for someone I see socially and yet keep it light and kind of funny.  Knowing she loves wine and has a great sense of humor...this was perfect.  She loved it and it really does look a little more expensive than it is and also I love to personalize a gift and this fit into all categori"
"OR";"I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered"
"OR";"SThey're incredibly thin, rip easily, bleed and are hard to get off the muffins. Splurge for a little more thicker ones, these suck."
"OR";"I have had this air hose for about a year now, and have nothing bad to say about it. It does its job, doesn't kink, and is easy to coil up and store on a hook. It's yellow, so it'll probably get dirty after some use, but let's be honest - if your air hose is clean, you're doing it wrong."
"OR";"Absolute love these dried tomato dices! I use in dishes! Currently on second jar. Excellent price...Will definitely order again."
"OR";"Overall good book. Loved the twist and turns. Interesting rake on relationships. I'm glad it turned out the way it did."
"OR";"A good value at 20 bucks.  The sound affects make it a very enjoyable toy for my kids.  I recommend it for your young Kylo Rens."
"OR";"This horse is amazing! He looks perfect in my collection, I highly recommend this model, I also love how he is in the same pose but different coloring."
"OR";"Great writing, sharp wit and a continuous theme of love/hate towards the world of British gentry he belonged to. Mostly dark humor as I enjoyed from previously read Saki short stories collections, but the two novels were a total surprise."
"OR";"to me,it's true.he always sounds the same,and that's always good.cool side interviews with him and other musicians in including dr.john and alan tuissant."
"OR";"I was a bit skeptical at first because I have never used this type of equipment before but this is fun! I highly recommend. %100 money back guarantee"
"OR";"Part of a series this romance has everything fans of the genre could ask for. I will be watching for deals on the rest of the series. One sex scene (no gratuitous descriptions but slightly more detail then a kiss and a door closing) and pretty clean the rest of the way through."
"OR";"This book was very good I loved how much Jayce and Layla loved each other but were too afraid to show it to one another.  The misunderstandings were quite funny as well.  Everyone but the two of them knew what was going on.  I just enjoy the innocence of this series and it reminds me of the great ad"
"OR";"Have now tried this product on 5 different cats.  Two gobbled them down with tablet inside.  One would only eat if tablet was crushed, but did so readily after crushed and bits/powder hidden in pocket.  One cat just sniffed around it and walked off, but next day tried BEFORE feeding her anything all"
"OR";"They are very cheap, work very well on my Android and Tablet, better-made than I expected. Prefer these to a sharp plastic stylus, they won't damage screen!"
"OR";"Prattchett is simply wonderful! His sense of whimsy makes a delightful read! One can read his books at many levels..."
"OR";"As described, very nice, warm as well.  Has help up great through several washings and still looks and feels like new."
"OR";"I love this dress so much that I ordered this one for a wedding I will be attending in April. I did have to have some alterations done to it for the custom fit I wanted (a snap closure for the breast area and the sleeves shortened). I have a body contouring shaping slip with a built in bra, perfect."
"OR";"This is the first time I have read anything from this author, but it will not be my last ! Her romance stories are so good ! I can not wait to read more of her books!!!!!"
"OR";"It is a sturdy game and was as described.  I thought my special needs grandson would enjoy the Operation Game but it provided only a few hours of entertainment."
"OR";"Powerful and tiny and portable and a great price.  Please be sure, however, that you attach the sanding pad to the bottom...for some reason the hook-and-loop pad on the bottom of this device doesn't stand up so well when there's no sanding paper attached.  Go figure.."
"OR";"One of those things bought mostly because it LOOKS useful. Seldom use it but when I do it's as close to perfect as you can get for what it's made for."
"OR";"I received my ring today. It looks absolutely gorgeous. Time will tell if it will stand the test of time and still sparkle in a few months"
"OR";"We got two of these for our recycling and they work great so far (after about 6 months of use). They fit convenitenly under our countertop (with room to open the lid). The foot pedal makes it easy to open when hands are full. The lock is handy when carrying to the recycling area."
"OR";"32 GB-  holds a LOT of pictures and movies! Took this to England with me for an 8-day trip, took more than 700 photos and quite a few videos, and still have room for more. This is definitely the way to go! But don't forget to back up your files after you download the photos."
"OR";"Love, love, love my watches! They are so colorful. I have a larger wrist (7 3/4 inches) and they fit with room to spare."
"OR";"We had our pup on Purina Puppy Complete and he wasn't really eating it - we switched to this and he now can't wait to eat his meals. It has been great for us!"
"OR";"What a cute and fast read!! A free gift from the author! So worth downloading! Hopefully we will see more of Dec and Holly! Merry Christmas!"
"OR";"After reading the reviews I purchased this with the expectation that the bag wouldn't attach quite right, and that's exactly what I found. While it certainly works, the design could be tweaked just a bit to greatly improve the usability. I will say that having my phone easily accessible right in fro"
"OR";"When you install yours drill your hole at least 1/16"" smaller than the recommended size.  Otherwise it just is what it is, works fine, installs easy."
"OR";"This was a good read, with many positive examples from his life! If you area bit stuck, this is a good ""kick in the pants"" book!"
"OR";"I kept waiting for this movie to be released to play on Region 1 DVD players, but so far it hasn't.  Once I bought a multi-regional player, I purchased this movie and re-watched it.  James Corden and Julie Walters are fun to watch.  Great story of not giving up on your dreams."
"OR";"We primarily bought this for our granddaughters all under 9 years old. We believe that this classics are the perfect proper stories for girls even today. Let them enjoy The Hunger Games, but let them also learn what responsibility, pride, laughter, and love means as well."
"OR";"I enjoyed these stories very much. 4 stars because I wanted more! Each story could have easily continued to be something even greater."
"OR";"I cannot wait for sequel. A real cliff hanger. One of Patterson's best. I loved Alex Cross series, but this may be more addicting."
"OR";"A number of years ago my husband had acupuncture to help with the arthritis in his back and neck. I never realized that acupuncture could be used to increase fertility. Thanks to the author for sharing his great knowledge to help some couple become loving parents."
"OR";"My cat will play for about 30 seconds and leaves it behind. I have to give it to a friend. She has a younger cat. Hopefully her cat likes this toy."
"OR";"I absolutely LOVE this pillow cover and really enjoy having it on my bed. It's beautiful and unique and has a rich feel that makes me feel sophisticated. As a young mom, I love having this touch of class and indulgence in the one place in my house where I can truly put my feet up and relax."
"OR";"Manson's not-so-small contribution to self-help genre is taking really, really deep universal concepts and making them simple and self evident and non-intimidating (while not diluting the core). Which makes this almost the perfect book for the average ""new"" genre audience."
"OR";"Cute doll - looked a lot like the character from the movie. My daughter really likes it and LOVES the movie!"
"OR";"Fantastic. A little heavier than I expected, but that just means it's very solid with thick walls and bottom. Not seasoned well and it took a lot of extra seasoning to make it non-stick. Made a baked ziti in it after it was seasoned and it was great! Cleaned great and the ziti came out better."
"OR";"The live camera feed is easy to use. Great handling and fun to fly .When I had questions they responded quickly and answered all my questions."
"OR";"Use this when camping.  Is a good knife for the cost - sheath is a little flimsy, and I wouldn't trust my life to the survival pack - but its not bad at all."
"OR";"Book 1 has many layers that I enjoyed figuring out as I read! Many authors are predictable, not Ms. Strauss. Marlow (Mars) is a shy, geek that does not do well in social gatherings so starts up a conversation with a shy, socially awkward girl named Teagan through a chat room. This is where the adven"
"OR";"Great extra closet storage without the expensive shelving built-ins. Also good in coat closets for hats, scarves...."
"OR";"Of all the recipe books I have seen to date which support 'living low carb', this is my favorite.  The recipes are easy, varied and consistently good."
"OR";"I read both this book and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Both gave me insight into how others live in a different part of the world.  I had not seen the movie before I read the book.  I had to seek it out and see it once I finished the book.  Many should read these books that are so well written.  Histo"
"OR";"I put this on a sandwich, it tastes terrible. Looks like mayo, but it's not. Do not eat this. Works great for sealing leaks though."
"OR";"I ordered 1 pair and  used them for the whole day. Having 4 surgerys on my fused ankle W/24
screws. They were so comfortable & look more stylish, than elderly looking compression socks.
I ordered 6 pair immediately. Great compression socks !"
"OR";"This book was recommended by a very good friend.  I started reading and was a little hesitant because this is not a book that I usually read.  It took a little to get into it, but I did I could not put it down.  This is an EXCELLENT book and will be recommending this to a lot of people.  My review o"
"OR";"I am not quite to the uncomfortable stage of my pregnancy yet but the belt fits well and I think it will help a lot.
It seems like exactly what I needed for my previous pregnancy to alleviate low down ligament pain and to help carry some of the baby belly weight."
"OR";"Nice saw!  I bought it for my grandson as his first power tool.  I have had the same saw for 15 years and it has always worked well."
"OR";"A combination of haunted house, demonic possession and supernatural terror. Minus the teen slasher juvenile antics present in most horror of late, Good acting and an effective slow burn to a powerful ending. Creepiness' abounds. recommended."
"OR";"I knew what I wanted before I ordered from Amazon, and I must say their service was excelent. The Sony CD/DVD player does everything I expected from it, and the HDMI works well with my 42"" Plasma HDTV.The price for the Sony was reasonable, and the shipping was fast. What more could I ask for."
"OR";"Great Cooler. Cheaper than other high end coolers, with what I consider better features. Extraordinarily robust construction, with secure yet easy to operate latches, and well through through double carrying handle options make this the nicest cooler I've ever owned. We recently took it on a 7 day r"
"OR";"My father read this book to me the first year it was published. I was nine and it has been on my bookshelf since. I can't tell you how many copies of this I have purchased for people.
This is a great book to encourage thinking, not simply memorizing. Each page contains new language, new ideas, new w"
"OR";"My dogs love these and the best part is they last forever! This is the one toy they can't chew up. It keeps them busy for hours!"
"OR";"From Pam Becker ... this was a wonderful, magical novel!  I just loved it, and hated for it to end.  It was fun to suspend reality for awhile every day."
"OR";"it quit working but was past the one month time frame to get it fixto much money for another one."
"OR";"A must when using multiple cameras. I run two GoPro's on my motorcycle and I can run for weeks at a time with only 4 batteries and this charger."
"OR";"i have purchased 15 of the new adidas green star balls for the kids I coach.  The kids are high school varsity and they love them."
"OR";"I love this thing! Not owning a microwave means I needed an easy way to heat milk that's easy to pour without a mess (unlike a saucepan, I'm clumsy). Along with my Aeropress and my frothing wand, it's cappuccinos every morning!"
"OR";"It has important information for California legal writing techniques, but obviously it's not very interesting. If you need help sleeping at night, a great read."
"OR";"This is a great game. My 6 year old loves to play and it works great to help with her sight words"
"OR";"I love love love this pair in Iridescent/Black! Beautiful shape and stunning texture, comfortable. It is teeny tiny bigger than my Jessica Simpson pumps. so my heels are a little loose but not coming out of the shoes when I walk. but I don't walk a lot in high heels."
"OR";"Super cheap, grips rub off after it hits the ground 50 times. Very poorly made. Paid $7 on black friday for it so I cannot complain however its not worth it, maybe as a christmas gift for a six year old or for a baby to roll around with it."
"OR";"I have a single cable running from my router to the TV room and my Sony Blu-ray is connected to it. I wanted to add my laptop because we stream from Viki and that's not on the Sony unit and only use 1-device at a time. I tried an ""Ethernet Splitter""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-l"
"OR";"This is a new author to me and I found his book to be quite exciting.  I am now on the second book of the Jesse Stone series and find it to be just as good."

They are very attracted to each other but are constantly fighting their feelings for each other. Slowly they give in & start building s relati"
"OR";"Good product and I think that they are better than the other snagfree types. A much better weaving in your product. THE others i had to cut off the snags."
"OR";"This is very nice; beats the plastic ones sold in grocery stores by a mile.  Brush appears very sturdy; still don't know where to get replacement brush heads,, but wand is certainly worth keeping.  Product is Very happy with look and is well made."
"OR";"Board was used it has MANY knife cuts in it. Does not have John Boos logo on it as picture shows. Not even sure its the same product. Not happy."
"OR";"Make sure you install it right but exactly what my old maglite called for, made a useless thing useful again. Love it."
"OR";"It works fine so far and seems to be fairly sturdy. Although, I will have to see how it holds up over time. I'm not sure where this product is made but,  It does have some plastic components to it and if it's made in China, I suspect it may not hold up over time. I will post review updates as this p"
"OR";"This has quickly become my most favorite of all my flashlights. Very versatile, easy to carry and with the diffuser wand can be use like a lantern. Very Bright;  Excellent!"
"OR";"This is a very good idea! Having the capability to save content from either computer of handheld device is exactly what I had been looking, for! Price is reasonable, as well!"
"OR";"LOVE IT, LOVE IT!! Works great and to be able to listen to music with a beanie on in the winter is GREAT! Love the color too!"
"OR";"Good books for early readers, especially in Kindergarten where they typically loose their first tooth.  I am making a tooth fairy pillow to go with this book for my granddaughter. She loves Fancy Nancy books and is anticipating losing teeth like her Kinder friends."
"OR";"I purchased two, one of the pressure switches broke right out of the box. kind of disappointing. Overall worth the money paid  for  them."
"OR";"This book was ok.  Seemed a little slow at times talking about meaningless  things and hard to follow. I did like the interaction between Tristan and Lily, when they were hot, they were hot!!  Ended with a little bit of a cliffhanger, curious on where this story is going to go if there is a book 3."
"OR";"What a great Book!

Author is a truly gifted meditation teacher.
His instructions are clear and he has a way of making complex ideas very easy to digest.
I've practiced many types of meditation over the past Few days and even though this book,I recommend it highly."
"OR";"One of my favorite star wars t-shirt. I really like the photo!
The t-shirt has good quality and the size was perfect."
"OR";"Pretty great headphones at a great price.
The cable is very long which is great, and the music comes through very loudly as well."
"OR";"Great movie, had wanted to see it for such a long time, thought I might be disappointed but it was refreshingly different and entertaining with twists."
"OR";"The Walt Longmire series is great !!  I would recommend this series to any one who likes their mysteries with a little Western flair."
"OR";"The author developed a story you could not put down.  The ending was unexpected but was a fulfilled one.  I am looking forward to reading more from this author."
"OR";"Bass is muddy but acceptable in a speaker set in this price range.  If you can recall to take extreme care when assembling, disassembling, or moving this speaker set, and if you're not looking for high fidelity, this is probably a perfectly fine purchase.

My wife moved the woofer to make room while"
"OR";"Perfect size. Loved it. The handle broke off and I am not sure I can fix it. I will try though because I really do like size and shape."
"OR";"These pants are great, but not for cold weather below 40. Also they are very slippery so when you take a corner on you're bike you slide around a lot."
"OR";"These look even better in person.  I had a certain necklace in mind to wear these with when I bought them, but I find myself wearing them all the time.  Very comfortable, and stay on well.  I've purchased hoop style clip-ons like this before that fell off constantly, but these stay right where I cli"
"OR";"Very cute, love the pearls, considering trying to remove the flower, but either way I'm glad I purchased for a ""dressy t-shirt""."
"OR";"Always get water in them compared with other glasses that don't get water at all. Maybe they are good for kids not for adults. I recommend you other glasses."
"OR";"Good way to get my lazy hamster to move around or shall I say stretch. He nibbles and nibbles away on this all night"
"OR";"These items was SUPPER CHEAP, and worked GREAT.  I had checked around before ordering, couldn't bet the PRICE and it arrived on time!!!"
"OR";"These were MUCH too small for most projects. Short of sealing a bag or sausages, I'm not sure what you would use these for. I purchased them to build cages, and they just wouldn't work.

On the plus side, they are comfortable and easy to use. I like the idea of the auto feed, much more convenient."
"OR";"Too thin to hold much.  I ended up buying ""poise"" pads and cut them each in half to put in our doggie diapers for our senior dog."
"OR";"Great birthday present for my 4-year-old niece. Good size. Great Price. Shipped fast. Perfect condition."
"OR";"This is your typical cheap, made-in-China-esque product. That's fine, but it wasn't .99 - it was what, $6? I got it for evening walks with my dog and at first, I was really happy with it. It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars "
"OR";"The lids are more grey than bright white and the glass has several inclusions but I like the price. If they do not last, then I will provide an update and remove some stars."
"OR";"This was a great story! Loved how legends and certain other concepts were put together in the story! Lots if hot and steamy scenes !"
"OR";"This thing makes a real difference in my small basement shop. Easy to use and install. I love the remote and timer on it."
"OR";"Stick great and are so much fun. Easy clean up and storage with the bag, and we've had them for 6 months now with no mold/mildew/funky problems."
"OR";"Fun!!  We had a blast playing with this in the pool.  We used water guns to see who could spray it to the other side first & we played volleyball with it too.  It's pretty big, we thought the wind might take it out of the pool but it didn't.  This was a big hit with the kids & the adults!"
"OR";"They're very comfortable but wow do my feet sweat way too much in these.  I've had these type of slippers before and never had this problem.  For wearing an hour or so they are super comfortable but beyond that they literally get squishy inside from the sweat.  Sorry if that's TMI just being honest."
"OR";"My cat loves this - she thinks she is the queen sitting on the top.  She plays with the toy and uses the scratching post.  It looks nice too."
"OR";"Great movie. My grandson loves it. He is just 3 and sits through the whole movie. Plays with play swords and pretends he is in the movie."
"OR";"This ball is smaller than expected.  Would be perfect size for a toy breed.  My Shih Poo still loves to play with it."
"OR";"I am pleased with this toilet seat.  It is attractive, seems well constructed, and works perfectly (quiet-close feature).  A little pricey but worth it."
"OR";"Absolutely so small. I normally wear an XL with no problems but the 3XL in this is too small!  Such a great looking shirt but sizing is TERRIBLE!"
"OR";"Best bras ever, follow the fitting guide and you can't go wrong. They fit great, are comfortable, and last."
"OR";"I really love this griddle.  Food does not stick, it is really easy to clean and it does not unevenly like so many other griddles I have owned."
"OR";"This is an interesting, plausible story of one of the first people of color to attend Harvard.  A good story, beautifully written,"
"OR";"Beautiful story of an unspeakable act, rape. Lena full of love for her son Jonah. The gift of said rape. Frank spoiled & evil. Luring young girls then taking advantage of them beating them into submission. Lucas the lawyer with a past of his own."
"OR";"Worked good at first  until the grooves got clogged. I prefer the hand julienne tool for a better noodle in the end."
"OR";"Makes cleaning every part of my Camelbak Bottles easy. I was searching for something to clean out my bottles and straws this works fabulous."
"OR";"Seriously - where's the story? I. Find it hard to believe Dick Francis wrote this s-l-o-w paced meandering book. Skip it."
"OR";"Sharp is an understatement! Didn't realize I cut my self taking them out of the box. Shoot great fly just like my field points."
"OR";"Nice and well written story. Being from Chicago ms Black was on point with all the location in the city. I love a good ending."
"OR";"not for med size rooms maybe a room 6by6 six no larger, i wasted my time and money on this product, sorry,but, a fact!"
"OR";"Each one in the series just gets better.  A wonderful  escape from the doom and gloom headlines of every day life.  Ladybug Farm is a seven book series and I already know I'll be suffering separation anxiety when I'm done with them all.  Off to the next one:)"
"OR";"Love these shoes although they we're a little snug and I even got them a little bigger then my size I'm sure all I have to do is break them in!"
"OR";"This movie is well done and acted. We've watched it 4 or 5 times. It is always enjoyable. Drew Barrymore shines again."
"OR";"A little laugh to go with some great big characters. Loved this book! Good job Robyn Peterman!"

"OR";"This is a great unit it was in several power outages and one brown out were the rely in the unit pulled in and out over 156 time in just 26 minutes"
"OR";"I should have ordered them a half size smaller. This happens to me a lot with shoes, so no big surprise. Otherwise, they look and feel great."
"OR";"I have 2 TP-Link TL-WA7210 and they have been working great until about 2 month ago. One. i am using as a bridge and the other one as an

"OR";"First let me say I must have a real one because it is great! Does everything I wanted it to do, better than I expected. Extremely good clear picture. No complaints at all except of course the manual is quite useless, but the menu is reasonably intuitive so just go with it. I like it so much after se"
"OR";"This ring is beautiful and fits well. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the ring is too thin. Bends really easily."
"OR";"And they don't tell which one to buy?
And it costs $15 on their website?
And it costs nearly $10 to ship it to your house? SERIOUSLY?

I WAS BORN AT NIGHT, but not last night....

I don't think so. I'll buy a knock off brand & have it shipped for $5 thanks."
"OR";"My Guinea pigs love these!  They arrived on time and the expiration date is almost 2 years away.  They're a little hard, so I soak them in water for about a minute.  My Guinea pigs reach for them and can hardly wait to get them.  Great product and Seller."
"OR";"Super light weight. Real fast start up. Google Drive is easy to use and you get more than enough memory. Having all docs in google Drive is really convenient and provides a back up place to store you're docs or videos or whatever"
"OR";"Well written and interesting story. A bit over the top in places but I still enjoyed it. A definite page turner. First time reading this author and it won't be my last, thankfully it was on the kindle unlimited list so I could read it as I  will read others from the list."
"OR";"Poorly made, failed first time I used it.
Can not handle any torque at all without inside cable spinning in crimp connector."
"OR";"I've used the Weanas 12V LEDs for landscape lighting, so I was looking forward to using these 3W AC/DC 12V LED bulbs in other fixtures. They work well and give off comparable light to the 20W G4-base bulbs they replace. I'm happy with these."
"OR";"Ashton Kutcher did an admirable job portraying Steve Jobs though his posture was kind of off putting toward the end of the movie."
"OR";"Even though it took me months to finish reading
this, which was a first for me, It was an ok story.
I could have done without the drama  though."
"OR";"Pony was definitely cheap, but the box/play mat is okay. It is small so be aware of that before ordering! It is the perfect size for my 2 year old daughter though and even my boys 6 and two 4 year olds run off with their sisters toy to play...."
"OR";"There is a ton of excess zipper hanging  from the inside (it itches). I thought this was a full zip. It is not, it goes down to my naval and stops.  It doesn't stop like a normal zipper that has a guard. The zipper is stopped by questionable stitching rather than a zipper end."
"OR";"I've now had this TV for a year. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have a sony ps3 and an iPhone. Streaming to it from the phone is hit or miss. My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want"
"OR";"Got several sets of these through Amazon and they're all great.  I've dropped em in the sink a bunch and they haven't chipped or shattered."
"OR";"This is a solid piece of gear. I ordered it after seeing one at a friends house. 5 years old, and the handle shows no wobble. No warping, despite repeated misuse (kids). Then there's the lifetime warrantee. All in all, a sweet deal, a lifetime purchase."
"OR";"I loved this book it made me smile and cry one of his best! Can't wait to read the next book."
"OR";"Can't beat the price.  We were building a new home and wanted these buried in the wall so we needed a lot of them and at this price it did not kill us to do it."
"OR";"We're using a pair of these in a TV studio environment, and they're working great.  Well constructed, just good, basic cables."
"OR";"The product is reasonably priced but it doesn't look realistic at all ..it's four blow up decoys that I used today to go turkey hunting ..I heard all kind of turkeys clucking purring gobbling or no turkeys will come within 60 yards of the decoys"
"OR";"Bought this as a gift with a cookie jar and the recipient loves the mats!! She even asked where I purchased them. Am thinking about buying another set for myself :)"
"OR";"Choosing the three gallon size was wise, a five gallon bottle was awkward for us oldsters. It holds enough water and is easy to carry with the side handle when full. The bottles seem sturdy although only time will tell how they hold up."
"OR";"This is a cool toy. Both my boys love this! Being playskool it's made very durable and will hold up to younger children. The only reason I gave it four  stars, instead of five, was because the top of the ship and a few other pieces do come off and on very easily, which can frustrate the kids and you"
"OR";"i really love this, it looks just like the picture and was worth the extra money casue it works for holding my clothes pin"
"OR";"I love that not only is the Bible Cover soft it has a durable zipper that holds up. I can toss it in my purse and not worry about ruining it. Also words are in red."
"OR";"Sometimes you gotta let go and let time take care of matters of the heart.  Nice love story once one of the main characters wised up to take notice that all she ever needed and wanted was within an arms length away."
"OR";"Cheap. Sits in the bug out bag. Helpful if you live in a region with lots of water like me. Reduces the need for on hand preps."
"OR";"I am a teacher and have used this toy many years in my preschool classes.  I expect my grandbaby y to love it and get years of use from it."
"OR";"If you have pets this is a great product.  I clean ears, eyes, cuts, etc.  Very gentle and effective.  Not for serious wounds .... see the vet."
"OR";"This thing will hold your camera onto anything, as it is very strong.  I had one of the legs pop off once, but I was able to put it back on, so that's the reason I took off a star.  It's a little bigger than I thought it would be, so I would consider the smaller version of this if you don't have a l"
"OR";"movie was ok. I expected more special effects. wasn't worth rental price.
wait to see it on Netflix or rent from library."
"OR";"This drum is the perfect size for my 1 year old. I like the noise that it makes and so does he. Great value as well!"
"OR";"I really wanted to like this book because I love old photographs and the concept of time travel but It just didn't deliver what I hoped.."
"OR";"Just beautiful. Nice, large scarf gives lots of styling options. Also got one to give as a gift."
"OR";"Have used for my 5 gallon turtle aquarium. Downspout is long enough an and very easy to access and clean. Nice clean tank."
"OR";"Sometimes hard to follow and read, I think due to the translations. It was creative an wonderful story following ""the white wolf"" and also reviewing his memories. The characters and are fun and inventive. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes a like fantasy fiction."
"OR";"A small external drive that backs up my computer.  It is easy to take with me and I have satisfaction that if my computer develops a problem, I will not lose my files and applications."
"OR";"Excellent Danish series! Great characters and good plots. Wish American TV crime drama was this good."
"OR";"I was looking for something simple and not too expensive.  These fit the bill just fine. They are light but not too flimsy, just right for fresh out of the shower. I really like scuffs because they are so easy to walk in and out of at the bedside, and maybe out to the mailbox. I wouldn't mow the law"
"OR";"We have 3 older dogs that need this for their joints. They love the taste and take them with no problems. The price is the best on the Internet that we have found!"
"OR";"This book was a very heartwarming book!! I hope she turns it into a series! All the books by Hazel Gower that I read I have absolutely loved."
"OR";"Well made and sharp. Great little knife for the money. I keep it in my car to open boxes and so o have a knife handy."
"OR";"These shoes are pretty well made and pretty comfortable. The main purpose of these shoes is help those people around the world that would contract a disease through their feet and this is preventable. I do not work for Tom's Shoes but if your buying these shoes to last you for years or rock climbing"
"OR";"Much better than the last superman reboot. Love how they just pretend like the last one never even happened."
"OR";"Came pretty quick and came exactly as described. Has English audio and english sub, also is just a must see movie."
"OR";"thank you, Mr. Grisham, for the realistic portrayal of a child torn apart and manipulated not only by the mob but by the federal government.  it just goes to show that us kids are still the most vunerable in life.  scary for  me as a young girl, but exciting and eloquent.  again, thank you."
"OR";"I bought this product as well as the TP-LINK AV500 powerline starter kit. Both are great products and can recommend both. One thing to keep in mind, they will be no better than the internet you have coming from your router.
I did a YouTube review on both. If your like to see the video here's the lin"
"OR";"I am loving this!!  It's the perfect size... big enough for any dish!  Nothing sticks, it heats quickly, and the two handles are great!!"
"OR";"Classic movie that I was thrilled to find on DVD. I was a little worried about quality since it is an old movie but it was a great picture."
"OR";"I had been looking for a jean shirt to replace my old one.  This shirt is soft and fits my SHORT figure to a 'T'.  Usually I purchase a large, but decided to order an XL since the fabric is 100 percent cotton.  Happy I did. Washes well.  Did not put in dryer."
"OR";"I've purchased two of these mice.  The first lasted about 3 years before the double click issue became so frustrating it was not longer usable.  I did like the feel and other features of the mouse, so I thought I'd give it another chance and purchased another mouse.  Keep in mind this was when the p"
"OR";"Writing long mandatory reviews is annoying and people should not be forced to write anything. A star system is enough to express opinion."
"OR";"My daughters love them!!! I did order one size larger than they normally wear. No issues with the width. The zipper back is helpful too."
"OR";"The only reason I am not giving it five stars is two reasons. One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around sl"
"OR";"Nice leash with comfortable handle. The leash itself is a little more lightweight than I would've liked but my dog is not really a puller so it will be fine."
"OR";"Great for lots of things.  I use it as a finish on my mixed media paintings/ virtually water proof and eliminates finger prints."
"OR";"Had a lot of dice since the 1970's and these have been my luckiest lol. Not that they will save you from a gelatinous cube when your party is in a forest but hey, nice dice thanks!"
"OR";"When I saw this DVD I thought it might be good with Penn directing and the cast, but now I can see why I do not recall seeing its trailer at a theatre or on my tv screen....
The dialogue is badly muddled some of the time.....e.g. when Frank and Joe are alone on the porch of their old farm and runnin"
"OR";"My daughter loves this plush reindeer.  She was a little bigger than I wanted, but it worked ok with her Rudolph.  Very cute scarf and bow."
"OR";"I'm using it right now. It's just the right size for my hands (I wear large gloves). Of course it's not going to fit into your palm, cuz it's small, duh. But it's easy to hold by the fingertips. The buttons and scroll wheel have nice, satisfying clicks and it slides easily."
"OR";"I can't believe I never saw this before. But as an avid collector of family-friendly Halloween films, I had to scoop it up. It's a charming film about a man who creates sleazy stories for the tabloids then happens upon a real ghost story and discovers his love of real journalism all over again."
"OR";"The Good Things
*Great photography style and quality.  Every scene is fascinating.
*Interesting group of characters, with lots of interesting and memorable moments.
*Good dialogue (and good monologues).
*Very interesting, broad view of the issue of drug addiction.  It accurately captures the good an"
"OR";"I bought two, one malfunctioned within a week. The alarm goes off several times a day. I placed two in the same room, this one goes off, the other other doesn't. Placed both next to an opened window, same thing: this one goes off for no reason and claims there is fire."
"OR";"First off i wish to say that i haven't ridden a bike in a little over 9 years...YEA...its been awhile. I went to my cousins house and saw that he had this bike in black and gold pretty much caught my attention immediately. I took it out for a spin and fell in love with it. I quickly decided to get m"
"OR";"I like the way he makes history interesting and easy to visualize.  His use of many characters, make the stormier interesting."
"OR";"Work great and liked the value enough to buy 2 so I can keep one on my workbench and one on my cart."
"OR";"My bulldog absolutely loves this product. He will sit patiently wagging his little tail so excited and loves how it feels on his body."
"OR";"Perfect vest if you want a little extra resistance when doing plyometrics or running. Fits small women really well because you can tighten the velcro strap. I run with it and find it does not flap around at all. I also like how you can add or lessen the weight with the weight bags"
"OR";"It has a bit of red hue to it.  That's not the biggest problem in the world - make sure to do a white balance correction if your camera allows it."
"OR";"Great product. Our german shepherd loves them. Most importantly the squeak. They also hold up very well going through the clothes washer."
"OR";"I saw this movie in the theatres limited run for Academy qualifications.  Expected much for disappointed as I could not get an emotional attachment when emotion was vital to the storyline.  Also it's hard for non-Japanese to understand the ghost world myths so that may have something to do with it."
"OR";"Can't wait for the third book!  This was a great continuation from the first book, Fall of Giants, or could be a stand alone."
"OR";"My oh my oh my. Blue Saffire has done it again. Hmmm, love the alpha males that she brings to life. I think I just found my new boyfriend Wyatt! LOL, but seriously. I love the way she connects the characters of her books.

Wyatt is the oldest son of Joe and Cassidy Black. He has been deemed the hear"
"OR";"These were ok, the printed side was great but the non printed side is just all white. I could have printed these off the computer and saved a little money."
"OR";"The storyline were great. The characters are heart warming and interesting and the book was hard to put down. Great book to read."
"OR";"this is a movie that if you are a whiney self involed queen will think is tacky ad if you  like cheesy then watch it if not run away now not worht it"
"OR";"These fire well and the price is perfect. Just be careful not to accidentally hit metal of shoot at too hard of wood. Remember it's only a plastic shaft."
"OR";"Standard two door wire crate, but has larger gauge wire than some. Probably would not work for a dog with separation anxiety."
"OR";"The movie is OK, the story quite upsetting, however, the editing is not quite what I expected, long, long, long close ups."
"OR";"Thick plot, lots of operational prep work and set in a very real scenario, Gabriel Allon never fails to deliver!"
"OR";"I can watch this on repeat all day long.  I love the Bluths!  Definitely worth every single penny I paid for season 3"
"OR";"My kitten pretty much ignores it. I know catnip doesn't affect cats til they are older so I will just reintroduce the toy to her when she is grown."
"OR";"My hydro flask insulation stopped working because it rolled or if my backpack during hiking. Fortunately hydro flask has replaced it with a new one."
"OR";"Really enjoyed reading this series of Alaskan mysteries. Dana Stabenow has a real knack of keeping the mystery flowing until the very end. The romance is just enough to be believeable  considering the main character. Enjoyed  reading from first book...hope she keeps this series going!"
"OR";"My grandson just loved this toy.  It came when it said it would arrive; sooner in fact.  Thanks So Much and Great Value :D"
"OR";"Finally bought this item then ended up buying 3 more. A very nice good looking quality fixture for a low price."
"OR";"Good price for the size. You can't go wrong with f10. I use it as a daily disinfectant and as a cleaner. It's safe, so you can use it on the cage while your bird is still in it, just make sure to remove any food and water first. It doesn't have a chemical smell and was shipped carefully."
"OR";"This unit is wonderful. I had torn a knuckle the day I ordered this and my knuckles now have protection. So easy to use! I would buy this product again."
"OR";"This is wonderful.  Heat from the bottom while sleeping is a more restful night's sleep.  I have arthritis and wake up stiff, not with this new heated mattress pad. We are very pleased."
"OR";"I lost this product but I loved this cup so much that I plan on getting another one when I get the money. Thanks for reminding me."
"OR";"Handcuffs are great, keep them cleaned and oiled and they last very well.  Next time I think I will go with ASP though."
"OR";"Works great for holding our flat screen on the wall. Our TV is 70 inches and it holds no problem. Easy to install."
"OR";"I do not like to retell the whole story of books,as it already has happpened in other reviews. That said, this book was tense, very real, and kept me reading at all hours. I was so involved that I felt the country, I knew the langauge to be genuine, and I became upset at the downturns. I loved it. W"
"OR";"Well made product for Jake & neverland pirates fans. No complaints. Their bodies twist. They're about 2-3 inches tall."
"OR";"Great show...just like all the other seasons.  Have to wonder how much longevity this show will have since they only shoot 3 episodes per season."
"OR";"very elegant top and nice soft material. love it. I wish it comes with different colors because I would love to order more of it."
"OR";"I enjoyed this book very much. The story was well written. The characters were believable within the story. It was a nice read."
"OR";"Can't beat it for the price. The kids love them. Turns your tablet into a mini laptop. Seems to be good quality so far."
"OR";"I thought this would be more of a recipe book.  It is a guide (packed with scientific info) on women's health, women's bodies, and women's weight issues and explains why we women are very different from men.  There is a lot of information, it's a big book.  But I think the science is important and w"
"OR";"I bought this for my daughter last Easter. She was only 1 and a half. She LOVED it and still plays with is all the time!! Cute and easy to play with."
"OR";"This box includes tattoos for both boys and girls which is great.  Most the kits in the store are for boys or girls, but not both.  If you have girls who are not girly, this is a good option."
"OR";"Great shoes (M870v3). Wore them down flat but now the model is discontinued.  On to M870v4!

Good fit, not too heavy. Good support."
"OR";"Used these for a Halloween costume. they fit as I thought they would, but the color was a little different than it looked here, but it wasn't so different that it was unwearable. I like that there were so many pockets and places to put things. I didn't even have to carry a purse or anything all nigh"
"OR";"My boys love these sets!  They have a blast putting these together.  I like finding 3 sets so they can make a Mega Mixel!"
"OR";"I didn't mean to start reading the book right away but while I was waiting for my husband I read the first page. Then the first chapter and then when I got home I snuck off into the hammock and read until it was too dark and realized all I had left undone. A compelling, smart and rewarding read."
"OR";"This is part of Alistair Horne's four remarkable books about the military history of France from 1870 to 1962.

This  volume chronicles the collapse of the French army and government in 1940. No matter how powerful your army, lack of political will ends in defeat."
"OR";"Great concept. Hope not to need it but takes little space to store it. Good piece of mind. Recommended it to friends too."
"OR";"My two spoiled Siamese cats love this stuff.  Wish I could find a cat food they liked as well."
"OR";"It doesn't cover everything  I had a smaller one that was much better.  It is very big and heavy for an older person who sits in a chair."
"OR";"A nice idea that my daughter loved, too bad the quality was so poor that it couldn't even last through its Second Use."
"OR";"I really enjoyed this book. The characters were interesting and the story line was good. I couldn't put this book down until I finished it."
"OR";"My cat loves it! He goes crazy every time he smells it. I have a toy that I add a little bit of it in it and he plays with it for hours!"
"OR";"Order this along with my cotton candy machine and it taste great. Creates nice soft cotton candy in seconds using the Great northern cotton candy machine. Just doesnt seem to have as much of a strong flavor as the other type of flossugars do."
"OR";"Great well-built shoes. Comfortable from the get go. Really appreciate the quality construction of Stride Rite shoes."
"OR";"This spray is very aromatic when first sprayed but the smell dissipates quickly. We have 6 kitties and ended up rescuing a stray Tom about a month ago but we're having a difficult time integrating him into the family. I feel like this spray works for calming some of the cats but definitely not all o"
"OR";"I'm a high handicapper and this club was needed for those steep walled bunkers since I have problems hitting a ball with an open wedge as I should.."
"OR";"I purchased these ear protectors for my wife.  She has taken an interest in
target practice.  I liked the DB rating and especially adjustment
capability.  They arrived as scheduled.  It's very comfortable to wear and
a great start towards her shooting experience. A great product at a
comfortable pri"
"OR";"Nice sound.  For the price range it's a great option. Use it by the pool.  Does seem to take a bit of time to sync."
"OR";"Also reviewed the Light tension (blue) and have owned a red medium tension for years. Have found the series reliable and versatile."
"OR";"I heard about this from CNET and a few other places.  Thought for $20 had to try it out.  Hooked it up to some small JBL bookshelf speakers I had at home and plugged in my android phone.  While not audiophile quality (due mostly to the mp3 files i guess), the sound was fantastic.  Highly recommend t"
"OR";"This was a very well-written book and very entertaining. Just like all the. Jack Reacher books.
Going to start book number three right now."
"OR";"This is a very interesting and well written book.  In many ways it reminds me of Cormack McCarthy's Border Trilogy.  Good read.
."
"OR";"I like this thing but it's so small. How I wish they had made a larger one. I will know more this summer if the sun shining through it will make a fire."
"OR";"Excellent quality.  I was super surprised at quality and power.  I sent a metal dart completely through a large orange at 15 yards."
"OR";"My puppy destroyed this thing in one day, the squecker was torn from its body well before the frog was decapitated. do not buy for dogs."
"OR";"This is the ideal Batgirl figure! Designed by Greg Capullo, Barbara looks perfect in black and gold. I think one of the best aspects of this figure is her gorgeous face with full lips and stunning blue eyes! A must have for all Batgirl fans!"
"OR";"Sixth sense was awesome, signs was good, and the village kinda sucked, but you already knew that. But a good price for an entertaining bundle."
"OR";"if I knew what I know now that I know what I didn't knew. I would have gotten a bear canister because these things don't last thaaaat long."
"OR";"I used to have a Linkys router and thought my internet service was bad because my wifi would work for a few days and then drop. I got this router and have had zero drops and the speed is fantastic. I have all of my computers and devices hooked up to it and I stream Netflix through my Wii all day wit"
"OR";"Simple to use device  to test electrical outlets for reverse polarity, GFCI circuit protection, missed grounding of outlets, etc."
"OR";"We buy lots of dog treats and our dogs do love these we think they are a healthy dog treat and well worth the money."
"OR";"I  was looking for a soft glow but these are even more yellow than in the photo (I'd assumed it was ""enhanced"") and are much more artificial than I've seen elsewhere."
"OR";"got this thought it was the dog pill pockets when it got here and it for cats we thought ok , then we opened them and they were dry and the dogs did not dig'em"
"OR";"This is a great bralette. It fits me perfect (32D), might be a little loose on smaller chested people. No padding either."
"OR";"These were perfect for me what we needed them for. There does seem to be very slight height differences but the widths were all the same for me. For the extremely low price they are a good value. They look nice and even when loaded with bath products have held up for me. Could they be nicer? Sure, b"
"OR";"Imaginative, entertaining and fast paced. Look out Harry Potter. Welcome Chloe Masters and friends with a different kind of magic. This may have been written for teenage readers,but will appeal to most fantasy afficionados, Looking forward to book two in this series."
"OR";"heavy and sturdy, the gem hasn't fallen out and my daughter loves it. however, it is definitely not easy to get it to stay in the hair!"
"OR";"Sticks well, but over time about a year it showed ripples where I slide it in the iLuv case. I need to learn how to get it replaced."
"OR";"I loved the ingenuity of Red what a wonderful character. The gentleness of Micah with Shannon. The easy openness and sharing of them both. I was pleasantly surprised by the intrigue toward the end of the story. So very typical of how God works in the lives of the Believer. He has everything under co"
"OR";"I switched out all my the handles and deadbolts in my house with these when I moved in, all of the doors have the same key now. Installation was easy, and rekeying was easy as well. I got the Kwikset Smartkey padlock as well so I just have to carry just 1 key instead of 6. So far, after a month they"
"OR";"Love these. Work well on my shihtzu and now I feel better knowing I won't scratch his eye out. Cuts nicely on his fur."
"OR";"I ordered this ""new"" watch and received a used watch with no face protector and already running its battery. I contacted Amazon customer service and they shipped me another one. Second watch was in same condition so I returned the watches and asked for a full refund."
"OR";"Super easy setup. The software needed is built into the camera. Picture is good. Controlling the camera via the web is simple."
"OR";"I read quite a few books by Rhys Bowen.  I read all of his Molly Murphy books and I liked every one of them."
"OR";"It's a great toy, the dogs love it.  I love the tail that moves independently from the goose.  Really, really love it."
"OR";"This really is a great addition. Had to saw a pattern for a trellis into 4"" PTL, worked like a charm. Excellent product."
"OR";"The fabric is thin however foot the price it was expected. Loved the look abd can't wait to rock these in Vegas!"
"OR";"Thought I'd give this a try, it's a little gappy in front but the sides dig in a bit. Still, it seems to stay up okay but couldn't be worn with a tight fitting top cause the cups bow out a bit. Great for my racerback tops though."
"OR";"I thought this was just okay. It is nice and thick, but did not keep me superbly warm, so I was disappointed since it was quite pricey. I thought that these wool thermals would be considerably different, but it feels like I am just wearing a thick 100% cotton top. It is also a loose fit."
"OR";"A remarkable life story by a remarkable woman.
Sotomayor tells of her life experiences in down-to-earth terms. It is a warm and wonderful book."
"OR";"Overall its working great - I just have to turn it off and back on sometimes so that it plays audio from a WDTV live player. But at this price its a bargain."
"OR";"I needed a soft silicone case to use so I could change the battery often.  This one fits, I would purchase again!"
"OR";"The author is too eager to tell his story to properly tell you the story that is the reason you bought the book. Before you even start the first chapter of the book, he tells the story of what happened to these men. Then you have to skip every other chapter where the author tells his story of writin"
"OR";"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my very intelligent 1 and 3/4 age niece, and she was convinced she had an awesome cell phone she could use."
"OR";"Jessica and Simon are recalled to Mogo for training, meanwhile, Volthoom, the first wielder of a Power Ring is back controlling of the guardian Rami for his own ends.

Simon and Jessica's training dominates the first three issues and these are interesting bits. It's great to see them interact with t"
"OR";"I put this on one of my bikes and it snapped right in place. Transferred it to another bike (same saddle) and it took a little finesse. Transferred it back to the first bike for another ride and it broke. Stick to traditional fenders. This might have some sex-appeal, but it's not durable."
"OR";"One of the best books I've ever read!  You'll fall in love with the characters and want to read it over and over again!"
"OR";"This is about the size of a deck of cards (bulky in my opinion), construction is OK.
For the money, find the VIPERTEK 17,000,000 Micro stun gun instead. Much smaller, bigger punch, fits into hands easier. I have both and like the 17MV one much better."
"OR";"This is my first experience with Author Sabrina and I'm so glad I read this. It's short, hot and very captivating.  I am a sucker for friends to lovers romance."
"OR";"Surprisingly, this flat piece of plastic (with silver inlays) actually works, bringing in all 19 available channels in my area. However, you really do have to find the sweet spot on your walls for it and that might require a longer coaxial cable than is provided with the antenna."
"OR";"This is everything I hoped it would be.  It works well for my Jeep in getting the lugs off fast to help cut some of the pain out of doing the rotars"
"OR";"I loved the bundle!  I read all the way through so quickly!  The character is so real and has attributes that we all have, I guess that's why we relate so well to her.  I am waiting on the last book to download in a few days, I hope more books are written in this series.  I would like to see Riley h"
"OR";"The premise  of the course was quite romantic and as a result the reader conjures imagines of the novel should be.  This book at times felt like a noble from the nineteen century.  Also it promised hot steamy sex, don't waste your money it contained none."
"OR";"I enjoyed reading this book. The very original plot unfolds on the background of a fascinating hypothesis: the conscience as result of quantum processes in the brain cells. At the end of the book you can find a very complete and well-organized list of readings to further investigate the theory of qu"
"OR";"Very nicely detailed book about the maldives . The author has done very nice research and got a lot of good information collected about the places to go and the things to do. It seems to be a must go place in our lifetime not just for honeymoon but even for a nice little vacation. Great book.."
"OR";"The product stickers didn't fully come off the bowls, so now it's forever stuck on there. I ended up buying new bowls that are dishwasher safe."
"OR";"Fast, Funny a Family Favorite. Paced well, great special effects, a little on the line like Jumaji."
"OR";"Great idea, but way too weak of a light to use anywhere except a pitch black roan. Not practical for slide shows in a club or office environment. I returned it and spent four times as much on an entry model office projector."
"OR";"I don't like how the top fits my daughter, something about it looks strange.  It is a cute outfit in terms of the style and color."
"OR";"My pup has several collars and this makes making him ""legal"" much easier.  City tags and id tag and both be moved very easily!!"
"OR";"These are comfy like tennis shoes but cute like dress shoes.  Easy to clean and easy for my tot to put on."
"OR";"EXCELLENT WATCH, I USE IT EVERY DAY, NICE LOOKS, STRONGLY RECOMENDED BY THE WAY, I HAVE FIVE OF THEM WITH DIFFERENT COLORS"
"OR";"This story will break your heart, and lift your spirit. It is a cute love story, but the over all story of learning you are more...that is worth reading."
"OR";"Love it! Perfect size & looks very nice & hides my husband's messy desk perfectly! Recommend for a space-saving organizer."
"OR";"Purchased for a friend as a gift ! It's so beautiful I might have to buy myself one ! My friend loves it and said she is constantly complimented on how beautiful it is !"
"OR";"PICTURE INCLUDED: the perfect size medkit. not to big and not too small. Great for hikes and EDC (every day carry)"
"OR";"We are quite happy with this scale. We use it primarily to weigh out coffee but have used it for recipes as well. It is accurate and easy to use."
"OR";"My dog is very picky and I have to change out bowls quite a bit. We haven't had one like this and he seems to definitely like the change!"
"OR";"Desert Of Souls is the highly recommended first novel of an Arabian Nights-style series by the new author, Howard Andrew Jones.  As many other reviewers have already somewhat detailed the storyline, suffice it to say it relates the adventures of a scholar and the captain of the guard of a member in "
"OR";"Found the colors to fade together to be a pale-ish light red rather than a distinguishable red and white check .  They are short, not at all generous.  Once baked, the colors is almost lost. Pulled away from baked goods avg. Won't opt to purchase again."
"OR";"I love this item, it is just what I expected. My dog is very secure and safe inside it, even though he's a baby he still enjoys it."
"OR";"Great product to get if you're looking to upgrade your network. Although pricey; it gets the job done great."
"OR";"That Miles Standish was a stone cold assassin. This and much more forgotten information is the reward of this fine work. He makes history interesting."
"OR";"I use this hoodie when I'm on my motorcycle to keep warm and to keep the sun from burning me alive on cool days. It definitely gets the job done and I will be ordering another one.
FYI It's not going to keep you warn in real winter weather as to be expected."
"OR";"as always. I like reading Grisham. Intensity was also good, as the story itself. Many differenet characters, who were not fiction but reality"
"OR";"This is a creation in gauze, lace and brought together with a pretty satin bow.  The lace bodice is perfect and the rest is layers of lace and tulle."
"OR";"Very interesting movement back and forth in the book for both characters and timeline. Well written, compelling look at suffering and culture."
"OR";"as an amputee, I collect all things legless!
this actually is a sturdy, working, cork screw.

"OR";"Perfect size, fit exactly into bed frame.  My 16 and 13 year old daughters put it together."
"OR";"I love breakfast so this one was a good find.  A different take on breakfast but still tasty.  Would recommend to download."
"OR";"Really like it. It's a good heater & a nice ambient light. The fire display is fun to watch & the remote is handy."
"OR";"I got these for $9.74 ea. A great alternative to rugs at about the same price for storage. Offers more protection. My only concern is the foam inside affecting the bluing on  the gun, so I have wrapped my gun in a silicone cloth. No worries now. Plano has done it again with quality at an affordable "
"OR";"All time classic. LOVELY story and animation, reminiscent of The Beatles ""Yellow Submarine"" in style. GREAT MUSIC by Nilsson and narrated beautifully by Ringo Starr. Every child needs this and you'll still love it as an adult! My kids, now grown, still do!"
"OR";"Delivered June 26th, 2015. Stopped working August 23 2015.

Two months and amazon will not take it back.

Update: Took it to service center and received new one from Black and Decker within two weeks."
"OR";"It delivered a good read.  Its a good book to travel with and read. Entertaining and easy to pick back up and read."
"OR";"Worked great for 2 months.  Everything sounded warped yesterday, and today I've got Chipmunks.  Very disappointed."
"OR";"love love love my cookware....it's been 2 years since I've had my cookware and I still love it...it still looks great, my food DOES NOT stick to the pans, they are not too heavy and wash very easily.  I would buy this set again in a heart beat for someone as a gift."
"OR";"Great bra, I love it and wear it every day! I'm a 38 HH and it is so hard for me to find good bras."
"OR";"I must say that I LOVE this arkham blue suit Batman! The blue is perfect and it came with the exclusive sticker which it terrific! Satisfied!"
"OR";"Very comfortable right out of the box.  The neutral color is great and the style goes with about anything you'd wear.  Very happy with my purchase."
"OR";"Never thought about buying pants online until i was kind of low on pants and there i am hooked , might never bought in a store now lol"
"OR";"Easy to use and works great. I read reviews on this product all over the web before buying it and agree, very good product."
"OR";"Can I please get more?

I completely fell in love with Leslie, although I had fallen for him before, this book just proved that my love for the funny, quirky guy was well founded and deserved.

Leslie has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth, but it is honestly so heartwarming to read about a cha"
"OR";"Barry Raspbody has a unique sense of humor.  Most of the jokes were a bit of a stretch.  There were a few good, although painful, puns.  He also had a few that makes one want to smack either their forehead or his.  They might be easier to understand  and appreciate if they were presented in a comedy"
"OR";"Works fine but a little awkward and took more strength to use than expected. Maybe dough too thick but felt like plastic housing might break, didn't feel sturdy. Will probably buy a more expensive ""gun"" squeeze type next."
"OR";"It is a little pouch. Seriously though, it fits my FiiO E11K headphone amplifier, and a pair of reserve earbuds. That's about all I can ask."
"OR";"Just received it last night. Took it out of the packaging and there are some stains on it. Not sure from what. It's for my daughter and she will try it in a week and I'll be able to comment on comfort."
"OR";"let me know when their is one around and you know who I mean , lol, love it and they cant tell I got one either"
"OR";"Quality is not so good.  Each piece has some splinters in it.  Took us forever to get the set to the smoothness that we can allow our child to play with it."
"OR";"If you are a fan of historical fiction, you will love this book.  Lots of intrigue, deceit and lust!  I loved every minute of this novel!"
"OR";"It started out good and became a nail bighter. Read this you won't  be disappointed. I'm  getting the next one soon as I can."
"OR";"This is my 4 months old favorite toy. His eyes light up when he hears him or seems him. It has so many different colors, textures, patterns, sounds...it's really just the best toy I've found. I've gotten them as gifts for expecting mothers. Definitely buy this."
"OR";"The rice cooker came with a steamer basket and a rice scooper. The overall design is the standard for a rice cooker. With 12 cups, it's more than enough for me."
"OR";"I can not wait to see more movies with her in it. Can you get anymore movies out faster, lol. She is one of the most funny actresses that I have ever watched."
"OR";"Great trains as usual. My son does notice that bill and Ben seem to change colors a lot. He still loves them"
"OR";"This was a replacement for the same pump that I have under my house for our dehumidifier.  It works great and gets all the water out and away from our house.  Very easy to install and wire."
"OR";"Solid durable stockings and clip up well. Great for warmer weather when PH is not comfortable and you want some color on your legs."
"OR";"so far 50 holes on one bit through 5 1/4"" LVL's attached to SYP piles, about 12"" of solid wood."
"OR";"It was just ok. No mistress ever just leaves with no drama! Too unrealistic. It could've ended in so many different exciting ways. Just not really impressed."
"OR";"Works much better then the cooler master I had bought that lasted a year while making horrible noises the whole time."
"OR";"Put 2 of these in the new kitchen exhaust hood. Look great, good light color for the cook top."
"OR";"Great scratchers.  They are the same quality that you would buy in the pet store, only much cheaper!  They fit the commercial round scratchers."
"OR";"If you like the stars, you'll probably like this romantic comedy.  It follows a typical--though not entirely predictable--formula, but both stars are delightful throughout."
"OR";"This book was enchanting, enthralling and endlessly entertaining where stubbornness and determination to rise above conflict with a core of steel to get where love and happiness lives! The only thing that you need then is God's grace to cover you up!

"OR";"Bought this to help my wrist hinge and positioning and this thing works as described,  feedback of what you are doing is instantanious and this helps correct bad postioning."
"OR";"I was very disappointed with this purchase for my 5 year old.  It is very small, hard to transform, and comes apart very easily.  There are better Transformers out there."
"OR";"Amazing.
Robert Ludlum mixed with Tom Clancy and Webb Griffin., with the added science fiction/science fantasy elements.
At the same time, actually based on the various ideas floated before the onset of World War II.
A remarkable effort."
"OR";"Great product have been using these since I got em, haven't stripped a screw yet and haven't broken a bit."
"OR";"I purchased the cake pop kit as a Christmas present, but when my daughter opened the cake pop box Christmas morning, the donut maker was inside. The donuts were fun to make & tasted yummy...just wish we would have been sent the correct item!"
"OR";"I was a little surprised, but happily, it is the perfect size. It is smaller than I expected, but so easy to handle, and it does not diminish the sound.  Very pleased,Straightforward operation."
"OR";"The British TV series Midsomer Murders is difficult to top in terms of characters, plot and setting. It is simply wonderful entertainment."
"OR";"I have 3 dogs and 2 tend to be picky eaters.  No one every objects to Milo treats, esoecially the bef sausage,"
"OR";"Works well enough for what I use it for (as a test server). I'm tempted to get something else similar, perhaps a NUC with Core i5 instead, for a family member. It works really well, is quiet, and you can put it anywhere as long as it has ventilation."
"OR";"Great pricing and they were here very quickly.. Other stores are so overpriced the prices range wildly so this is great to get a good deal delivered"
"OR";"I bought this as an extra long cable for using it in the car for a long road trip.  Cable working great so far."
"OR";"We love Playmobil! This set is really cute and lots of fun. The only part we didn't care for is some of the pieces don't stay attached, so we are having to reassemble some of the parts every time we want to use it. We still like it and it won't keep us from purchasing Playmobil in the future."
"OR";"I love this leash Especially because you will never forget your waste bags. I only gave it 4 stars because sometimes the button does get stuck and you can not bring the leash in. I don't know if it's just the item that I received but other than that it is a great leash and I am very happy with it. A"
"OR";"I purchased VIDBOX to convert our home videos from 8mm to disc.  It was a time consuming endeavor, but it worked perfectly.  The image was a bit grainy, but I was not sure if that was the fault of VIDBOX or some other factor.  I am just glad I was able to get videos on disc for backup purposes."
"OR";"I saw The Suitor at the Sacramento French Film Festival this year, and bought the whole collection for the Sacramento Alliance Francaise.  Pierre Etaix has a deadpan comedy style much like Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd.  Some of his film, like The Suitor, could easily have been silent films.  The se"
"OR";"WONDERFUL for/understanding prospectives of 70+ yrs...We all know/have met one or more of these persons in our lives...DVD is MUCH better than the book!!"
"OR";"With the price I was really hoping this would work for drying shoes but the straps are not long enough to fit my dryer door."
"OR";"This is the best ever biblical inspirational novel ever told.  From beginning to end my breath was taken away.  I keep watching over and over again."
"OR";"I love these shoes! I get compliments on them all the time and they are super comfy! they came in a timely fashion and I didn't have any problems with the seller."
"OR";"Not comfortable, they push on my head behind my ears with a lot of force. I have this problem with a lot of safety glasses. Not trying to advertise another product over this one, but the 3M Tek are the only safety glasses I've found that I don't have this issue with. If you don't have this problem, "
"OR";"The wife dropped our iPad 2 and the digitizer completely shattered. Most folks think it's the screen, but the screen actually sits down below this. It took quite a while to remove all the broken glass, but once I did installation of this was simple. Looks almost like a brand new iPad."
"OR";"I received this book in exchange for a fair and honest review.

The Swallows and the Doves are neighbors and friends.  Illustrated so that those who are not able to read can follow the story along.  I appreciated how the lives of swallows and doves are compared and contrasted.  I learned more about "
"OR";"Holds about a hundred dice! Excellent pathfinder companion! I bought them to hold all the dice we use in the game and works great!"
"OR";"Bought 4 of these as Christmas presents for my family and friends fur-babies.  Every single one of them loved it.

I also bought one for my own kitten.  The toy is very detail, but more importantly, tough as heck.  We've played with it daily for more than a month and everything is still intact."
"OR";"Having similar issues to others. Programming interface is easy but the display is the opposite of that shown. the back light is very bright and the letters are dark"
"OR";"I like the bed cover, however, it sheds lint like crazy. Ive washed it three times on delicate cycle and dried it on delicate cycle as instructed but it still has a bunch of lint all over the place. Im hoping it will stop soon."
"OR";"Price was great. Delivery was outstanding. We've purchased the same food from the per store (20% more $$$), so, we knew the dogs liked it."
"OR";"I enjoyed reading this book as I was learning about some things I knew little about. The relationships and personalities of each sister and their reactions to their mothers hoarding. How the generations kept up the hoarding. The reasons behind the need for this way of life. The difficulties and brok"
"OR";"All Longmire devotees can not possibly pass this small book up.  It continues the incredible writing of Craig Johnson and adventures of Sheriff Longmire."
"OR";"I had to get all the Seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond, They are so funny, I watch them often with my kids, with some pop corn. Great Times."
"OR";"Item arrived and looks great will try this weekend. Disappointed it was advertised with a carrying case but did not receive one in package"
"OR";"These candles are advertised as fitting in the christmas chimes, but the thickness of the candles does not fit in any of the ones we have.  We have two versions of the standard ones, but these candles are not made for them.  The red ones are the right size.  I kep the red ones and returned the white"
"OR";"This stuff is awesome! It clumps really well and my little kittens track so much less litter! I was using one of the new litters that is really light weight and it stuck to their paws and got every where. This litter is barely on the floor at all. I'm very happy with it."
"OR";"The setup was easy.  Could use a little more instructions but you really do not need them. Works well and looks nice."
"OR";"I adore this pan so much so I have 2 but the colr upon the first hand washing I might add tends to be on the orangey side of the red family and not a bright Pop red... The quality is superior and the name says it all and the price was outstanding 5*****s"
"OR";"This shoe looks great but it doesn't provide the cushion or arch support I thought it would provide. It's ok. But not great."
"OR";"When you purchase the Nerf N-Strike Jolt Blased, make sure th purchase the refill pack. You can't have too may darts"
"OR";"One of the best seasons I have seen!  Season 33 is still my favorite, but so far this is my second favorite.  Loved most of the players."
"OR";"I bought this for my daughter for work, she liked it and said it fit good.  She didn't tell me if it washes and dries well."
"OR";"The first two books were great....book three....not so much....it was pretty slow...with almost no tension. I would have left it at two."
"OR";"These run smaller than expected but are still a nice quality and print. They looked okay out of the package but shrank a lot in the wash."
"OR";"This vest is okay, but the fabric is stiff and does not flow with your body movement. I only wear it around Christmas so it works, but I would not wear it regularly."
"OR";"This speaker will fill a good sized room and the bass is great. I use it for teaching and the students can always hear the music."
"OR";"Works great with PODs storage units.  I'm sure it would be easier to break the hasp than to open the lock."
"OR";"My dog LOVES it!!  I even give it to him as a little treat and at night put it one a little piece of Greenie so that's the last thing he eats at night.  I would definitely recommend this product.  An easy way of getting a little extra cleaning in during the day."
"OR";"My wife and I love them, they came on time and were easy to work with. The remote works very well and has many lighting options."
"OR";"Thoroughly enjoyed the boxed set.  Erotic with a strong story line.  Mia is head and shoulders above most erotic genre authors."
"OR";"The cable is nicely built with good connectors. It is flexible and can fit in tight places. The connectors have retaining clips so the cable will not pop off."
"OR";"This series has it all, romance, suspense, drama. I can't wait until book three comes out cause I couldn't put this series down."
"OR";"As always this show doesn't disappoint. The writing and the acting are great as well as the actors. Watch this show all the time! Thanks.."
"OR";"I am so relieved she does not fight to put it on. It keeps her from jumping into the front seat and actually helps keep her somewhat calm in the back seat."
"OR";"Fit my iPad Air, perfectly!  Instructional video link helped  immensely.  Now I don't have to worry about my screen getting scratched."
"OR";"This bag is large enough to put several layers of clothes in. It seems to be working well at keeping out and eliminating oders."
"OR";"I'll Keep It Short And Sweet For Ya...This Movie Was Great. I Was Into It The Whole Time. It's Way Better Than No Strings Attached."
"OR";"I like the message in the movie. People are not always your friend for the right reason. In fact, friends don't even have to be people!"
"OR";"This book was eye opening for me...
I so enjoyed Ms. Hanna writing a richer story.

Beautiful and tragic
Wellness done"
"OR";"I can't push on it hard enough to get it to dispense the salt. My husband can use it well enough. Am sorry I bought it"
"OR";"My step son LOVES these pajamas... he requests them specifically... he especially loves the cape (but we always take it off before he goes to sleep)"
"OR";"Loved it. great story as usual. Karin remains one of favorite authors. Cannot wait for the next book from her."
"OR";"IT IS THE BEST, VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND,QUICK SHIPPING. WITH BALLET IT HELPS TO WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN TO MAKE SURE OF YOUR PREFORMANCE IS ABOVE ALL SUCCESSFUL.WOULD DEFINATELY BUY AGAIN."
"OR";"This works really well, i know some games aren't meant to handle this but the ones that can, my goodness. Thank you for offering this product."
"OR";"Grips tore after shooting about 5 times, my XDS started moving in my hand, while shooting, when I looked the back of the grip was torn."
"OR";"This book was discussed on Amazon's romance forum. There are mixed feelings about this book. Some people just cannot get past the fact that the husband was violent towards his wife. I do not condone, in any way, physical abuse of anyone. This couple has been divorced for several years and he's had t"
"OR";"Look as described, seal great and function as they should.  Nothing fancy, but if I drop it on my stove, they won't chip the ceramic flat top..."
"OR";"It was a quick read, but it definitely caught my attention to go and download the next book to start reading right away!"
"OR";"My betta doesn't use it, but I don't think that it is a reflection on the quality of the product. It is bendable and nice looking. Serves its purpose."
"OR";"so far we have only used it once but it was so quite and it got our 3 medium dogs and two adults to where we wanted to be.  Great for bird watching."
"OR";"I got the aqua colored ones and love the color cause it's so different and looks good. So comfortable also."
"OR";"Dependable and affordable is a rare combination to find. But not in this product, which offers dependability and comfort to use.
I strongly recommend it to every Photographer."
"OR";"As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a re"
"OR";"Great motivation for kids to reward them.  Especially if they like trains and thomas.  These are good quality stickers and there are tons.  This will last a while!"
"OR";"Awesome toy for $15!!! The 2 very large adjustable figurine toys are worth the price alone. My son loves it!"
"OR";"Easy to put together took about 15 minutes solo.  Reasonably comfortable - not the best I've used but I like the look and it seems fine for my home office.  If I was sitting in it 6+ hours a day I'd probably go for something else."
"OR";"i got the exo terra one, its awesome, spend a lil more and do it right. your reptile will love your for it. there you go, i hope this helps."
"OR";"Worked great for about 2 days, and now it won't keep the signal. It stays on maybe 10 minutes a day, and has been the biggest waste of money I've had in a long time.

The notifications stopped working completely, and so did the motion alerts. Don't waste your money."
"OR";"I believe there are more than enough reviews here to decifer whether or not you plan to read this  charming, witty and candid book. However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN "
"OR";"One of my most favorite John Ford directed and John Wayne acted movies. Beautiful scenes in Monument Valley Utah."
"OR";"What's the next book in the series I got left hanging on a limb. I would have liked an explanation of why these bad cops did what they did."
"OR";"The serving closure on the top will not lock you will have to tape it down if you carry it, and that's  why I brought this item! I learned this the hard way. Brought two of these:-("
"OR";"I personally have not tried this but my dogs seem to love this stuff. Of course, they will eat dead rats and rocks so the recommendation has a limited reach."
"OR";"It works as intended but smaller litter chunks tend to slip out from the holes of this scoop. It'd be perfect if this scoop had smaller holes."
"OR";"Really don't like blind boxes because you never end up with at least one of each but a bunch of repeats but love Pusheen"
"OR";"This was a good book with good characters....well written....would read more by this author.  It was a little on the predictable side, but still enjoyable."
"OR";"Four stars for being cute asf However minuse one star for lasting a week on my keychain. Too sum it up, this is more decorative than functional."
"OR";"My hubby didn't love these.  He is fond of the Beach Body workouts and weight workouts but the heavy weights was more than he wanted, we ended up selling ours."
"OR";"Loved this musical...I've always been intrigued by children's voices, having directed their plays and choirs.  I continue to follow Jean-Baptiste Maunier's career."
"OR";"This is a great practice net.  My son is 10 and just really starting to learn how to hit and this net is allowing him the extra practice time he needs to get a proper baseball swing down pat.  It is really easy to put up and take down.  I would buy this again in a minute."
"OR";"Nothing new in this story, fast read.  J..D. probably cranked this out on a weekend.  Last one I will read from this author."
"OR";"Hence, some parts not fitting well like elevator, but love the flat screen TV built in for cell phone."
"OR";"This is a awesome cup. Two things I found wrong with were when you get the hot coffee in it the mug gets really hot. The lid started to shed plastic right when we got it. I think if you could fix those two problems this would be a perfect mug."
"OR";"Great product! Finally someone was smart enough to make such a good stylus with a fine point AND A POCKET CLIP!"
"OR";"It is a good toy, decent quality. It is pretty durable and not shedding like other toys my daughter has. Though, I think, it is too expensive for what it is."
"OR";"This was a cute use of rhyme to tell a different kind of story. My granddaughter loved the story because she lives pirates and princesses."
"OR";"Great table, easy to use. Use this at craft fairs and cover with a table cloth I also got at Amazon."
"OR";"2nd Review on Cesar! I love How they are soft and moist! I mix them with hard food for my doggies and they are so happy they love the gravy too"

"OR";"A wanted  Christmas gift for daughter and we filled it with waxed paper ,""gold"" foil , and more.  It was a conversation piece , as a gift -- being filled.
She was pleased with this."
"OR";"Like a mix of Sifi and Fantasy flick, very well done great story from beginning to end, a lot of action."
"OR";"Lily finally gets her life back thanks to Stone - what a story this is, to see your best friend raped and murdered, you brother and mother murdered to keep you quite, and finally a bribe - but is it all at the hands of the same person.  Another Great Wicked Lovers Book."

"OR";"This movie is so horrible it really will make you SCREAM!!!  ""AH, turn it off!""  Great for laughs as ""B"" horror movie go."
"OR";"Great quality. I've only had it for a few weeks now, but you can feel the quality in the carefully crafted tips. The cable is tangle-free as stated of course and the cloth jacket is of good quality. Now it's just a thing of seeing if they last longer than my last cloth jacketed aux cable purchase."
"OR";"I have always been fond of Roku and still use the first version they produced.

The setup is incredibly easy, though I don't understand how it would work without a computer.  The device upgrades itself fairly often, which is nice.  I can't believe how small this newest version is, but I like it.  I "
"OR";"I found myself laughing out loud as the characters reacted to the situations . I will look for more books from Hannah the story was great  and a uplifting afternoon."
"OR";"Wow the Walker brothers are just amazing.  Can't wait for the story on Braydon's twin.  I love Nicole Edwards books!!!"
"OR";"Great straps! Some don't like the thumb strap including myself, just don't use it if you don't want to and problem solved."
"OR";"End. Lots of suspense and drama entails the lives of Jack and Juliana both are caught up in different secrets that keep you on the edge of your seat. All the characters are equally exciting. Anyone that likes a good page Turner and a great mystery will  really enjoy the Novella."
"OR";"RAM is priced low, yet it is quality and works perfect! Nice upgrade to boost a system while keeping cost down."
"OR";"It's a great book! Some scenes took my mind a bit to wrap around, but it was enjoyable. A torture scene, no, the focus of the torture scene, I could've done without, but I realize that's my own issue, not how's it written. I look forward to the next book in the series!"
"OR";"This is a very nice, soft sweater. The color is beautiful. It fits me as I like--slightly loose. I'm 5'7'' and 120lbs, I usually get a small, but this one I got in XL, because I wash my sweaters myself and then dry them in the dryer (on airflow). They shrink so I always get the large ones."
"OR";"As always, Michael Pollan delivers a fascinating read. You never finish one of his books without being enlightened and inspired. As a foodie and someone who loves to cook, it was a real treat to learn about food through the lens of the elements: fire, air, water, earth."
"OR";"These are ideal to use when you're drilling between floors or when there's a gap in what you're drilling. I used mine to run etherwire between floors"
"OR";"Good source of carbon at a resonable price.  Large pellets thought, may want to cursh them down to a smaller size."
"OR";"Depends on what you want to drink. If you are using for coffee there are better alternatives at a lot lower price. It is a good beer glass."
"OR";"This bag is the right size bag for my Sony HDR-XR500V camcorder, cables and other accessories (remote, spare battery and memory stick)."
"OR";"I received this ARC for an honest review.  It was time for Sergei ' s story! Very enjoyable read although I would highly recommend reading the first 2 books first. I loved the way the animal side communicated with their person! Can't wait to read about GreyBear!"
"OR";"Got this bag it has been working great.  it is the perfect size for a 15in laptop with a notebook and a laptop power cable.  It has a different material on the bottom of the bag which is great as it will not get scratched.  I use the Metro rail and bus system to get to work and this is a great bag."
"OR";"Great invitations we used for our sons 2nd birthday. They were packaged well and were perfect for his Mickey Mouse inspired party."
"OR";"Very flimsy - pieces come off easily making play time with it more difficult. Could have been built stronger. Disappointed for my daughter"
"OR";"It works.
Thankfully, haven't had to use it.
It's small. Palm-of-hand small.
But if you're in the middle of trying to find you way out of the Great Quake of 2017 here in Southern California, I guess the last thing you need to be carrying around is some sort of enormous Boom Box."
"OR";"My son loves his toy organizer.  It matches perfectly with his Cars themed room.  It's not huge at all, but it's just right for my 3 year-old."
"OR";"I want to love it, but FM has too much static. An antenna connector would be nice. I cant read the markings on the buttons and they are dirty already showing on the orange rubber. The mini sound card slot does not work. These problems are just mine, they should not bother other people,"
"OR";"So glad to find such a beautifully done production. I love the English countryside and all that goes with it. Great story line and beautiful scenery. Fun to see Brendan Coyle aka Mr. Bates of Downton fame. before anyone knew of Downton Abbey."

"OR";"Kellan and Mallory's story was instalove but it was one heck of a ride.  A hard family life and someone that wants to cause trouble is a sure way to make tension and put everyone on alert.  Those Great Wolves are a loyal bunch of guys to each other and their women."
"OR";"How could the producers of this video show an abandon rabbit on the boat and dogs in a pen chained with no one in attendance? Is that not animal cruelty!"
"OR";"I was surprised at how small this ballast is compared to the old ballast. It has a larger amperage rating than the old ballast and the mounting was a bit difficult because you have to drill another hole. It is a few inches shorter than the old models. I tried it and it worked just fine in a very, ve"
"OR";"product was shipped on time, was well packaged and was of the quality I as expecting. I will definitely do more business with these people in the future! and recommend them to others."
"OR";"My son never really played with this much, he had a hard time changing it and when you get it in the truck shape the legs wouldn't really lock into place so it was kind of awkward for him to play with.  While he was in robot form the axe wouldn't stay in his hand. We were disappointed with this one."
"OR";"Another great one, I am loving this whole series, they can be read separately but best enjoyed if you read them in order"
"OR";"Nice period piece set before D-Day invasion. Great to see how the characters in the story unraveled until the very surprising conclusion."
"OR";"This is my fave in the series. Exceptional visual writing and author Savannah Young has mastered the ability to allow the reader to not only relate to the characters (who are quite charming) but deeply feel their emotions.

"OR";"The set costs less than just a ploarizer, and there are instructions on the internet on how to modify them easily to fit the z990. (Just use an emory board nail file to take off a tiny bit of the outside thread all the way around. Took 5 minutes and they work great."
"OR";"I bought this for my husband to sleep on in the back of his 4 door Jeep Wrangler when he goes hunting. It is a perfect fit and he loves it."
"OR";"If you are into teen age angst you will like this. Otherwise, not so much.  I fell in love with summer wars but was really disappointed on this one"
"OR";"Actually better than a lot of other movie's lately,  Not as good as the best but better than  most, PS  yes  I bought it and glad I did"
"OR";"Cheap materials (made in Sri Lanka)  that shrunk up in cold water and air drying. Very disappointed in the Calvin Klein brand!"

"OR";"Bought this to go under my work shirts because they are short sleeves and I needed to cover my tattoo.

"OR";"The fit is excelent! The red color doesn't effect nite vision (learned that when I was in the Navy).good for nite time traffic accidents wnen lite is in strobe mode. Extremely brite in btightest mode.just snaps on and off. Also comes in green."

"OR";"Excellent story.  Very plausible.  I hope to be able to read the whole series. Please continue to wright these fine stories."
"OR";"A pleasant watching experience through and through. Masterson, Thompson, Stoltz, Koteas, Sheffer, all give strong and enduring performances.

A little gem."
"OR";"I appreciate the variety and new recipes this book offered but it just wasn't what I expected so maybe my expectations where too high or different to appreciate what was offered."
"OR";"I bought this as a second one for my dog because he loves it so much!  The price is
So much better than in the store.  They wash up wonderful."
"OR";"I bought this novel for my book club, but have yet to read it.

"OR";"Had one before over 10 years.  I left it on my deck year round in all types of weather.  Very durable and most important it makes it easy for taller dogs to drink.  The adjustable height is great.  I've even attached an umbrella to keep the water shaded from the sun!"
"OR";"Our dog loves it! Now she turns up her nose at old dry food! Ugh.. mix in some dry to make it last longer.."
"OR";"I was using a competitor but switched to this to see. The way it was shipped was worth sticking with this. I have had other companies bottles leak everywhere or be slightly damaged. First bottle here was great. It's working well and my dog loves it. I don't notice a fishy smell but if there was he w"
"OR";"I'm a Christian romance fan, so I loved the sweetness of this story - enough that I purchased all three books in the series."
"OR";"Other collars irritated the sensitive skin on my short haired dog's neck. This collar has been great, her neck is healed and no new irritation!"

"OR";"Great looking suspenders, Well made. Sturdy enough for everyday but not for hard work. Great value."
"OR";"This is a nice inexpensive ball head. I did not want to spend a lot of money on a ball head and monopod, this ball head does the job."

"OR";"thick sturdy plastic. Works great for pasta and salads among other things. seems to be holding up fine. a ok."
"OR";"Works just like the stock GoPro battery if not better. Fast charger. Two additional batteries are more that enough for any trip."
"OR";"I loved this book. I've read a lot of the books on grain brain and paleo-type lifestyles. This was one of my favourites because it was so easy to read and presented the most compelling research. Dr Perlmutter makes it very hard to dispute that grains are not great for our bodies. Definitely worth a "
"OR";"I like the pattern and the ""stiffness"" of the corner. This stands up well and stays in for I set. It is a little dark but still a good choice."

"OR";"This is a step by step guide that helps to explore
chakra, coupled with effective
meditation . Sean parker has done a good work here"

"OR";"This was my third novel by author Lorraine Carey. I was expecting that same Classic Style of adventure, but in Out of the Ashes I found Carey had exhibited her ability to add a twist on that old Classic style using rich Native American legends with the paranormal.

"OR";"These are typical high Ottis quality, and allow me to select the right type of brush for whatever gun cleaning task I may have."
"OR";"I thought for the price that I was getting a large full sheeted booklet of stickers. It's not an 81/2 by 11 book. It's more like 4x6."
"OR";"These are NOT the pearls. These are the hard sharp chunks that neither my maine coon kitty or I enjoy stepping on. I love the actual pearls, but this sucks."
"OR";"This is a fantastic book!  I enjoyed every page -- through humor, poignancy, insights.
I'd highly recommend this book to just about everybody."
"OR";"Holy cow! This thing makes my MagLite into a light saber! I had a Nite-Ize led in my light and I dropped the light, breaking the old LED. I did a little research, found this. It is roughly twice as bright as the old Nite-Ize piece of crap. I am very happy with my purchase."
"OR";"It is time to wrap this series up! Before I even read this book I could have told you the following things were going to happen:
* Someone would die.
* Lulu would wear something ""poison green""
* Stephanie would be in a bind and call on the men in her life for help.
* Something would blow up.
* Steph"

"OR";"Bought this for my round dining room table for Christmas....just opened and was very pleased with the quality.  Thinking about buying a second one."

and interesting characters which makes for an enjoyable book."
"OR";"I have back and foot injuries, so low impact exercising is a must for me at the moment (hoping this will someday change). This trampoline is about as low impact as a a vertical land/terrestrial unit can be.

The first few times I tried this trampoline, I had to focus on balance, but I adjusted quick"
"OR";"This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly y"
"OR";"I use these cause I have to wear long sleeve shirts to climb telephone poles.  Most of the time its too hot and I wear short sleeve shirts and just put these on when I have to climb.  They work great and are better than a shirt cause they are pretty thick and protect against the small splinters.."
"OR";"Excellent work. Just a note on the other negative review on this item: It is regarding a Hungarian translation, which is not this edition. Amazon links reviews together and sometimes the review under a certain product is not actually for that product. This is one of those instances. Don't let it dis"
"OR";"Fast paced, keeps you riveted. One of my favorite by this author. Would recommend to anyone who likes suspense novels."
"OR";"I haven't tried to strength test this, but it looks like it is of decent quality. It's not fancy, looks like it was hand wrapped from a larger spool. Hope I don't need it for anything serious, but it's nice to have on hand for an emergency shelter or strapping something down in the truck."
"OR";"I first viewed this receiver at Best Buy and after thinking about it I ordered it off Amazon.  Free shipping and a slightly lower price.  Well worth the money.  It produces wonderful sound.  I've been using it mostly with my blue ray player and it really rocks."
"OR";"This is a solid starter set for those who want to start pressure cooking, I would say that the pot its self is on the cheaper side but still a great product. I noticed that it can require some giggling to get the seals to take hold nd start building pressure."
"OR";"I was intrigued with Robyn's personal journey and growth as a person throughout her trek across Australia.  It was long but glad I finished the book."
"OR";"You know how good they are. Make sure you have a tool made for crimping these--it will make your connections easier, quicker, and more secure."

"OR";"I added this to my new Samsung 55 LED TV.  it was easy to install and setting up the wi-fi system was a snap.  It's all fairly intuitive."
"OR";"At this price this rig is a steal. Rigs are priced way too high and it's often hard to find a rig at an affordable price. Without writing a huge written review I'll tell you the good things about this rig, the bad things, and the one reason why I think one should by this as soon as they can.

Pros:
"
"OR";"It works fine and was a great replacement when I frayed the cord of the original charger. I bought three of them to put in various classrooms."
"OR";"The image shown with this rod shows that it comes with a stop and a centering guide. These items are not included in the package, and they are the reason I ordered this rod."
"OR";"This product fit perfectly in the top of our ""bar-moire"".  I ordered 9 of them to span a 42 inch space.  Holds all different shapes and sizes of glasses including martini, champagne, red and white wine, etc.  Very easy to install and looks fab."
"OR";"As a strainer this works but i was looking to buy this to use with my 8 Qt instant pot which due to the handles makes it now fit."
"OR";"This thing has been a life saver with our foster pups. Keeps the puppy pad in place so the rambunctious pups don't toss it around."
"OR";"It is very pretty an flows nicely.  Will know more after several wearing but so far so good an will consider buying additional or different color"
"OR";"I won this book in the author's contest. I enjoyed reading it very much. The characters were so life-like. I will be looking for more of Annie West's books."
"OR";"I used it on a long backpacking trip where I wasn't sure about water sources.  Not a super bag but well worth the price."
"OR";"Jonas is fabulous, tough in handling breed affairs and  ready for love and his mate..sexy,breasted scenes determined to make you blush with heat."
"OR";"This is exactly what I was looking for to keep everything organized. If your a person that has a ton of make up you might need 2 but for me it was just the right size."
"OR";"We're a little tight at the knee and I am a small person. One had a little run in them. But, wore under jeans and they were much warmer than hose."
"OR";"Fit great, plenty of toe room for expansion as the day goes on. Really didn't have to think about them which is as it should be when riding a MTB."
"OR";"With a dog, a cat, a granddaughter, and a husband with Parkinson's, I have had plea try of opportunity to check this out.  It does effectively neutralize the odors of messes I have tried this on."
"OR";"The wire was easy to work with as I ran 5 lines and the resultant sound was great. Must have for any home entertainment system."
"OR";"If you are looking for a cheap LED pen light, this is your product. The screw is plastic, and tends to warp the plastic and shave plastic off. Be careful when changing batteries because of this.

Other than it being cheaply made, it is bright and works. I would buy this product again, just be warned"
"OR";"We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her w"

"OR";"Got this as a bday gift for a 7yo and she was VERY happy with it! He's big and squeezable. Quality is good enough for price."
"OR";"Story line lacked credibility. Too much contained in one story line to make it plausible.  This is to up to usual standard."
"OR";"This set is adorable. I wanted something for our granddaughter to put on after her bath (12 month old). She loves it. It is so soft and cuddly she wears it with just her little diaper. She likes to cuddle her robe. Color is adorable. The pajamas are a little fuller cut, but she is tall and slim."
"OR";"I purchased the eraser as a gift for my granddaughter.  She seems pleased with it so far.  I can not address any issues with the product since I haven't used it myself."
"OR";"Quite entertaining and a good hero. Light summer reading.  Parker has a good formula and he keeps working it effectively."
"OR";"Works wonderfully to date after a few months. This thing cooks an epic amount of rice. I haven't even been able to use all the crazy features on it yet. But all around solid product and it was at a great price point compared to other similar rice cookers when I bought it."
"OR";"This battery works great!  I'm so glad that it's still available for purchase.  My old Coolpix battery died 6 years ago and purchasing a replacement back then was really expensive.  I'm so glad prices have come down and I get to use my old camera again!"
"OR";"I loved it until one of the sides broke from pushing down on it. But I ordered another one. It is not heavy duty though so slice carefully."
"OR";"Loved it!  I enjoyed all the references to the hokey celebrity xmas specials of my youth.  And the nod to Pee Wee Herman's xmas special - a classic.  I nearly fell out of my chair laughing when Stephen chimed in on Willie Nelson's homage to xmas weed.  It's a direct musical quote from the strangest "

"OR";"What a awesome series.  Step into the lives of the Parker family and the ones they love.  Tissues, laughter and a page turning series"
"OR";"This was a gift to a fellow bread maker. Not sure if the less browning is due to using pan rather than just being on stone. Cleans up nicely."
"OR";"It is fast reading, and somewhat predictable . Good for beach or commute.  Didn't generate that much discussion in book club"
"OR";"Our 2 year old grandson was delighted with this.  We keep the sliding door closed so he is not overwhelmed by so many pieces at a time."
"OR";"Raine is a woman who is controlled in every aspect of her life. When she finally gets tired of it. She makes sure she goes out with a bang! She meets Dax for the second time in front of a port-a-potty of all the places! What an explosive story full of heartache, healing, and best of all LOVE!!"
"OR";"Cannot beat this for the price--PRIME!  Even though a quarter of a century old, the humor is fantastic and just naughty enough to be ""quaint"" in this day and age."
"OR";"Do last a long longer before recharging but the weight makes the tool heavier and a little off balance.  Will see how long they hold up."
"OR";"Just got this. It is not universal for ski poles. It does not fit on the slim carbon composite  ski poles. They don't tell you that. It also broke."
"OR";"3X is really long, but I suppose if the shirt needs to go ""around"" a large centered body some of that would shorten up."
"OR";"I loved the relationship between Noah and Delaine I had butterflies in my stomach the entire time I was reading. I Can't wait to read the sequel ."
"OR";"You will need to trim the foam to perfect specs, depending on your specific AK. You need to trim the muzzle break area according to your needs Cutaway is for a loaded AK and there are two additional cutouts for magazines. I had to trim the foam for the buttstock for my Yugo M70. Didn't leave much pr"
"OR";"This is a good book.  Held my interest throughout.  This is Irving's first legal thriller and the best as far as l'm concerned."
"OR";"Very good story. It made me want to cheer for the main character in spots and in others made me think he might be insane."
"OR";"Not totally waterproof. Front allowed some water thru, but only in upper section. Very long - will shorten. Nice patent leather finish."

"OR";"The way the author write is like you are waching a movie, and how a world in which I am not an expert you can understand it truly. I love Mark more than Nick."

It will not fit your iPad if you're iPad is in any type of protective case."
"OR";"Seems like it's getting harder to find shirts outside the ""standard"" colors, but I happen to like them. This particular shirt is just gorgeous. The pinstriping is subtle, but attractive.

"OR";"Great product! great looks for my Mac! Loved it! very easy to install
Just hope to last long enough!"
"OR";"These are nice.  I went with advice from others and went a size up.  They are big but I figure I can wear winter socks with them as they aren't really for winter.  And tuck my pants in them to show them off. More of a fall boot as they aren't a heavy material.  I love fringe so I couldn't go wrong w"
"OR";"Very nice Swing Set that is built with quality in mind. My grand child loves to play with this and her many Barbie sets."
"OR";"This is a great accessory for paintball or Air-soft, only complaint is it can be hard to breath through when you're exerting yourself, and it gets quite warm under that thing."
"OR";"Nice looking and well made, however, I had to return it because the fan was too loud for me.  I could not operate heater in my bedroom at night."
"OR";"You read of another viewpoint of the war: the animals. I passed this on to a Afghan war vet. He'd stayed at many places in the photos."

"OR";"I have given my keys to SO many people strictly because the following statement: ""Hey man, you got a bottle opener?"" Yes, of course I do."

"OR";"Easy to install. Seems like excellent protection for my 8 year old son.  comes with a black plastic insert that you must remove to install an ipad. I think the purpose of the black plastic insert is to hold the shape until you install the ipad."
"OR";"What kinda ending was that? Wasn't really feeling this book, it took me forever to finish, when I usually read 2 a day."
"OR";"This lavender incense is a favorite of mine.  Pleasant aroma, does not smell ""burnt"" like some other incense I have tried.  I would recommend this."

"OR";"I love to read trilogies and this series has not let me down. I'm looking forward to reading the third book in the series."
"OR";"This case is well designed for the original version of the Pro because it's single viewing angle matched what the OEM stand provided. On the Pro 2, the second viewing angle is very help, but the build of this case eliminates it as an option without removing it from the case."
"OR";"I really wanted to like these glasses but couldn't keep them on my head long enough without the retaining band. With that said, they are lightweight and comfortable with clear optics but having to wear a retaining band looking like ski patrol dudes from the 90's is not my thing."
"OR";"We were really worried this would not work but it works great. you just screw your bulb in the adapter and plug it into your weird lamp and voila."
"OR";"This is one of those marriages of convenience, a trope I often like.  The hero is turned off women, resenting his mother and all the shallow, greedy women of the ton she tries to marry him off to.  The heroine is distrustful of men because of having the most horrendous, abusive father you could ever"
"OR";"We bought this for my three year old son.  He enjoys playing with it.  It feels more solidly constructed than I expected.  I have no complaints with this toy."

"OR";"Great story well written can't wait to read the rest of the series. Hope they are just as enjoyable to read."
"OR";"Bought this to use in a commercial kitchen for hard to clean dishes. All employees used it when cleaning dishes and it got job done. Its durable as it wound up in garbage disposal a couple of times and was still usable. A two pack supply was nice for the money."

"OR";"I think it's a nice little rattle that my 4 months old daughter plays with for few mins each day. It lights up and the lights change colors everytime you tap it so it captures the baby's attention. my daughter loves trying to put the face part into her mouth but since she cant, she settles with just"
"OR";"To be honest, I really can't find anything wrong with this kit. The poseability is great, the balance is good, it comes with plenty of accessories (including those of the regular HG Jesta). At the end of the day, it's not my favorite design, but you really can't go wrong with this guy."
"OR";"Great little motion lights.  Just wish they could be a bit brighter for my needs, but still a very good product."
"OR";"Replace the candelabra sockets in my celling fan with these... awesome idea and they work fantastic.  Fast shipping and seller was great."

"OR";"If a book starts out with foul language especially GD, I won't continue reading it. I read just a few pages and deleted it from my tablet."

"OR";"Very good belt. I use this every day , and use it in competition for Idpa and uspsa and 3 gun. The belt is thin but very well constructed. I don't think I'll ever use another belt. Very easy to loosen or tighten. Very sturdy under load."

"OR";"A great knife, for a great price. Get over where it's made. Razor sharp, and stout as a nail. Get one."
"OR";"This was a good read a lot of drama, which kept me wanting more. Harmonie went through a whole lot to be so young. I cannot wait to read the next book to see how this all ends.

"OR";"Liked the action. Would give 4 1/2 but can not post the 1/2  this movie keep my attention. I did not go to sleep"

"OR";"Another thoroughly captivating, kept-me-up-reading-all-night story by Josh Lanyon. The story being told in Griff's POV really worked for me, I really connected with him, and reveled in experiencing everything through his eyes, and having access to his impressions of everyone he met. Griff and Pierce"
"OR";"Kid really likes these Smart Toys games - travel and full size.

Pros:
1) A travel game with fairly strong magnets
2) A cute penguin theme

Cons:
1) There is no place to store the unused magnets while the child is trying to figure out a solution - they just fall all over the car floor or lap. What m"
"OR";"A black ""demon"" cat (or is he?), a native American shaman of indeterminate age, a beloved grandmother, a nurse, a doctor: these are the motley collection of interesting characters you'll find in Forever Love. It's story of love that transcends time in interesting and unusual ways."

"OR";"I've used a number of other bluetooth headphones, and these have had the best sound and comfort by far.  My ONLY complaint is that they're not waterproofed, so using them while working out can lead to bad things when sweat gets into them.  Aside from that, I've yet to find a pair of bluetooth headph"
"OR";"Hot sexy mc!!!! Piston was so sexy pure alpha!!! But he was so awesome in helping belle..... Quick read but totally worth it!!!"
"OR";"Serves it's purpose. Nice inside compartment to put cable and other things. Not Bulky, pretty much the same size as the speaker itself."
"OR";"This is a classy looking stand -- now it is not tall enough for the Lladro ornaments, so measure carefully.  I put a 4.5 inch crystal, three dimensional, sun-catcher type ornament in mine and it is so pretty and sturdy too.  My daughter keeps hinting that she would like to have it -- too bad."
"OR";"It takes forever (guess it could be worse having to inflate with your mouth) but the hose will not stay on. So you have to hold the end of the hose in place on the mattress and the pump all while trying to pump the mattress up.
Other than that very frustrating part, the mattress does its thing and r"
"OR";"Dullest movie I have seen to date. If you need something to run in the background but not watch, it would be ok, but as a movie, it is a joke."

"OR";"avatar has nothing on this movie this is the best movie in american history. the era it was made in considering that everthing looks very real."
"OR";"These work great.  It would be nice if they had a brightness setting.  They are very bright and it would be nice to be able to tone them down a little."
"OR";"Interesting hypothesis . Not as far fetched as it would seem to anyone with a degree in microbiology or similar studies. Everyone is crowing about ""The Wave of the Future "",but the majority don't realize how close we are to the brink of extinction right now. Plausible tale of a frightening outcome. "

"OR";"My H2O mop gave out after a little better than a year; I should have taken an extended warranty as offered, but, then, how does one send the darned thing back if the original box for shipping hasn't been saved?  My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time"
"OR";"I have purchased a total of 4 of these Whipple sets.  My son and 2 older daughters each got one and absolutely loved making these creations.  They had so much fun with it that we bought one for their cousin for her birthday, too.  I've got an adorable little pie keychain now to show for it!"

"OR";"I love the story I love the action I love the Captain America cameo very good movie 5 out of 5"
"OR";"I bought this to replace the factory rubber clip-on holder for my fitbit. works great. I can see the readout through the mesh and it holds my fitbit securely. I don't use it as a tie clip though. I clip it to pants, throw it in my pocket, or clip it to my shoe when cycling."
"OR";"The graphics were great, but the sticker started coming off rather quickly. Good product... But not great, I wouldn't buy again."

I was very skeptical at first, "

"OR";"I like this item a lot.  Packs up small, nice little case.  I would like to have seen some reinforced grommets but that is a nitpick.  The fact I could fold it back up and get it back in its pouch is enough of a selling point for me.  Good bit of emergency kit."
"OR";"Came quickly and works exactly as described. The price is right too. If you need a USB to Printer parallel cable, this is the one."

"OR";"What a book i loved it my second favourite next to Rainbow Six by Tom Clancy.  I tore throught hat book so quick it was that good.  you read twice as fast and it doesn't exactly follow the movie.  I think it's better  then the movie.  Any way read this book it's great."

Very scary subject matter."

"OR";"It has been a fine slow cooker so far and looks very nice. I suspect after a couple years it will start breaking down since so much of it is plastic. We have gone through so many that are built like this but the more expensive ones don't seem to be any better in this regard nor do they cook any bett"
"OR";"Wow! This is very well written and HAWT! It's very short. Less than a 30 minute read. It's more like a scene from a book. I'm hoping they know each other at least in passing. What he does is like rape. But she's the one that opened the door after he told her what would happen. I want more though!"

"OR";"Granted I'm not really a mystery person and my apology to those who really liked this book but I thought it was choppy, confusing, and not worth finishing.

"OR";"These gloves fit ok,  but you get what you pay for. The finger tips of the right hand had these weird wads of fabric where they rolled it up to seam it or something. They are raveling a bit and I will have to return them.

"OR";"Great price for these batteries, but I ordered the wrong size. Keeping them because may buy something that the batteries will work in."
"OR";"A far fetched but captivating science fiction thriller.  While the premise is quite real, the facts and security premises are not quite believable.  I found it exciting although it pressed the imagination for realism.  I would recommend it to those who enjoy science fiction thrillers."
"OR";"The color is as expected. I was not completely impressed with the lack of plushness. However, it is a nice, light bedspread and I like the fact that it is washable."
"OR";"I ordered these mini cookie cutters to outline shapes onto my larger cookies that I decorate with royal icing, and these are perfect for that task."

"OR";"I love the paranormal and kinetic behavior. The mind is very strong if you have the ability. This was a good read. Would like to read more."
"OR";"The stories are good but the pictures leave something to be desired, in fact at times when we use this book there aren't pictures tat show up and at other times they do.
Kindle touch seems to be picky about pictures sometimes. Would consider buying a physical copy of this story book."
"OR";"Our three year old loves this T-REX! Lots of imaginative play! Well made toy and fun!"
"OR";"I have had the standard  charger for three years. It works. It also works in Europe with a plug adapter . No transformer needed.
This tip does not work on the iPad . It fits perfectly but only works  on the iPods and a few phones. Check the other reviews.
iPad requires another transformer. Be carefu"
"OR";"Billed as a link between the tv show and the game, this is an OK little information rag. Its got some nice pictures from the game."
"OR";"I bought this rug pad to replace a open waffle-type rug pad that I had used for many years. My, how crappy the waffle-style pad is in comparison! This is easy to trim down to size with decent scissors, and it feels great underfoot. Also, there is absolutely zero slippage."
"OR";"easy to set up, works great, picked up about 30 channels with a mountain between house and hill where transmitters are at ,what else can i say"
"OR";"Lots of wonderful scenic footage of the Maine coast lines from south to north. Wish there was more narrative on the towns and regions that were covered."
"OR";"The picture posted for this item is a fraud. It shows 3 pots and 2 pans with 2 lids. What you actually get are 3 pots and 2 lids.  It is very deceptive and this company should be ashamed. To return it you have to pay a 20% restocking fee. Very disappointed."
"OR";"Do not over tighten screws it will go right through the plastic.  I recommend finding at least one stud to hit it with drywall screws."
"OR";"I ordered this to display our wedding pics & I love it! Extremely well made & detailed. The advertisement photo doesn't do it justice!!!"
"OR";"I was looking for a simple inexpensive butter dish to replace the one broken by my dog. This one is a mite small and does squish the corners of the butter but it does the job. If you have twenty bucks or so to spend buy a better butter dish. If not you'll find this one to be adequate."
"OR";"First Impressions:

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

"
"OR";"Great dog food. Made in usa.in Tewksbury ma. My home town. Read the ingredients has all great stuff in it"
"OR";"They bent every time we tried to drive them in, not strong enough to hold. For many of the shutters we had to use screws instead."
"OR";"This is a good beginning textbook.  It is still being used in an online college where I tutor even though there are several more recent
editions.  I actually now have 3 different editions for different colleges and find them mostly the same.  Certainly if you want a book for personal use, this a bar"
"OR";"Perfect. Love it and the best part is it is blackout. I don't have to deal with the sun in my face early in the morning. Especially, on my days off."
"OR";"Not as good as Troy flip ups but what do you expect.  I hate the rear small opening (dot). But that's just me.  They work fine."

"OR";"This is one of my all time favorite Godzilla movie, it has Godzilla teaming upi with Jet Jaguar a robot against Megalon and Gigan..."
"OR";"This is a spin off of SG 1 and is also very interesting and fun to watch. It has very good actors and is well rounded with excitment and humor."
"OR";"This is a nice looking, easy to read weather forecaster.  It's simple and not full of a 100 metrics like some of the other ones out there."
"OR";"The plot was good, but characters not so good. This book was not a page turner...but at the same time would recommend for bored readers."
"OR";"EXACTLY WHAT I USE AND YES I WILL REORDER AGAIN.....ORDERED IT AGAIN, CAN'T BE ANY EASIER....AND FAST SERVICED AT A GREAT PRICE....JUST BROUGHT IT AGAIN AND THANKS AGAIN...."
"OR";"I was leery at first because the past Little Giant ladders I tried were just too heavy to be functional for me.  This is the perfect 6 foot ladder.  It is lite weight, stable and the platform and design make it one of the best ladders ever used.  I highly recommend it to anyone."
"OR";"this was the hit in the stocking!  Everyone loved it and my little boy (4) had it open singing ""raining"" songs throughout Christmas break.  Fun, practical purchase.  My purchase cost was less than plain ones from bigger retailers.  Very pleased with my impulse purchase! :)"

"OR";"These shoes are the most comfortable shoes, I would buy another pair. They fit really well and there a great look."
"OR";"Doesn't fit any of the tissue boxes I have in my home.  I think it will only take a smaller size (not the large ones that I buy)."
"OR";"This rack expands out to twice it's length, and you can fit shoes underneath it - so it ends up holding GOBS of shoes.  Great for a front hallway.  When extended out to it's max, it's easily 4.5-5 feet long.  Easy to put together and a total front hall saver!"
"OR";"I really like these candles. They look real, they have a nice vanilla scent. You can't use these to scent your space as they are very mild, but they are very pretty. I used them with pine branches at my Christmas party and people thought the flames were too close to the branches and would catch fire"
"OR";"I have been in the commerical concrete construction for 30 years and know the feel of a good , strong tool.

"OR";"The photo here on Amazon shows that the back of this wallet is not leather, but it looks like some type of woven fabric?  I would have bought this already and tried it out but I wish the entire wallet was leather, not just the sides that you open it from.  is the back really not leather also as seen"
"OR";"Picture perfect movie that tells a wonderful heart warming story.  The animation is exceptional and the scenes are saturatingly rich!"

"OR";"Nice product.  I bought expensive benjamin Moore paint.  I put XIM paint extender into it.  It came out beautifully."
"OR";"A peak at the fun side of age play.  This book features several short stories with a variety of themes.  Some of the stories revisit different characters but each story is a complete short story.  In each story you get the sense that everyone is getting exactly what they need and they are better off"
"OR";"If you enjoy guitars, great guitarists, and great music, then you must have this collelction.  From John Mayer to B.B. King, this collection displays some of the best talent in comtemporary blues and country music ever dsiplayed.  having Steve winwood at the end is not bad either!"
"OR";"As expected.  Works in my daughter bathroom just fine.  Be care to make sure you have about 5-6 inches between the hinges and the wall.  We have a little piece of tile border that is a little problematic as the unit hits the border when opened.  Follow the instructions and it isn't hard to assemble."
"OR";"It's only April my cat stay in the house but it seems to be working they didn't have any fleas and they still don't have any fleas will update in the summer"

I really enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. The storyline is well-written and emotions are going everywhere. I can't wait to read more from Sennah. I highly recommend this book."
"OR";"I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you ope"
"OR";"Used these cables to hook up blue ray dvd players.  Works just fine and the price is right.  Shipping was quick."
"OR";"If your cat is playful you will find that every toy in this multi-pack they will love. Great and inexpensive purchase for hours of play."
"OR";"I bought this pack for hiking in Alaska. The first hike I took it on was a 26 mile overnight hike. For the money it is a great pack. I had it loaded down and it was nicely balanced and plenty of room for what I needed. It seems pretty durable and for the price I would definitely purchase again."
"OR";"After having bought a seat from our local super center, we took a chance on buying one sight unseen! I am so glad we did! This is a top quality seat, attractive hardware, and not much more can be said about a toilet seat! Worth the money, and can throw out the junk bought previously!"
"OR";"I have purchased two of these and I love them - -I use it with a very large lab and it keeps him from knocking me over - keeps him in control - - great item -"

"OR";"This book along with the series is an excellent read.  I hesitated with the first book, because I thought time travel with civil war, but I am so glad that I went on and read the first book along with the series of books.  I would recomment to anyone that loves civil war romance."
"OR";"A dual retractable leash is a great idea but this leash is NOT a great product.  In fact, it's not even a good product.  Within a few weeks, one of the leads had started freezing up in the retracted mode during our walks.  Since I walk my dogs 2 miles each night, that could be get really annoying by"
"OR";"It was so hard to put it down!!!  I am ready for the next one...and the next. Well written excitement and, of course, our love story."
"OR";"Our cats love the crinkle balls. They slide the balls all over the floor and sometimes, carry the balls in their mouths. Great toy."
"OR";"An entertaining new chapter in this series.  One of the things I liked is how flawed the Princess is in this new series, likable but flawed."
"OR";"arrived on time, great product, looks nice and clean on the counter and works well, feels sturdy"
"OR";"This is a classic toy that children absolutely love. Toy is stable, well constructed, and a beloved favorite of the Thomas line"
"OR";"I'm 6'3"" 185lbs and size Large fits great.
Nice weight, perfect for SCUBA in Mexico/Caribbean."
"OR";"I can't say enough about these socks. I got these for a ballet barre class that I take and they work wonderfully. They've held up nicely in the wash. They don't slip and keep you from sliding all over the carpet . . . even while doing planks. A must have for any yogi or barre class attendee."
"OR";"This is a great quality hole punch at an awesome price!  It does just what it should do--of course don't overload it with paper, but it does about 10 pages very comfortably.  I bought it for random handouts I get in school and want to keep in my binder.  Serves the purpose well.

I would definitely "
"OR";"omg I absolutely love these.  The material is super soft & thick. I am 5'6 155 lbs & ordered a medium which was perfect."
"OR";"Nice belt at a nice price. Fits well and the color is good. I plan to buy additional colors."
"OR";"My Danske clogs are a 41 and loose fitting. The 41 in these Sophie shoes make my toes and heel fit the very edge."
"OR";"Sweet, works great! When plugged in it always defaults to VGA which is a little annoying to need to press for HDMI, but not complaining. It's very useful to be able to switch display with the push of a button. As with all of these cheap brand accessories, the quality is lacking but be gentle with it"
"OR";"Very good book. I was looking forward to the show but of course hollywood made it different. I prefer the book anytime."
"OR";"This cannister is exactly what it says it is. Easy to open and close and has a liner that is removeable and easy to wash. Doesn't show finger prints at all and wipes clean if you spill anything on it without having to polish marks off where it was handled. Very well made and stylish looking out on t"
"OR";"This product does exactly what I needed.  I converted from digital output to analog input.  Just as advertized.  It is plenty sexy, but it is now hidden behind a dresser."
"OR";"Quality rack, and installed in minutes.  Delivery was faster then expected, so overall a great product with quick customer service."
"OR";"It's very frustrating to try and fit it on the faucet head. It doesn't fit mine perfectly, so it slips off about half a dozen times during each tank cleaning and I have to reattach it. It's a serious hassle.

That being said, it's waaaaay easier to clean my 20 gallon tank WITH this thing than WITHOU"
"OR";"Nice bed. Going on 2 years now. The dogs prefer this one to the other two I have. Good bang for the buck."
"OR";"I bought this mouse for use with my Surface 3. Since the Surface is pretty limited on USB slots, I thought it would be best to have a Bluetooth mouse so that I wouldn't have a dongle filling up my singular USB slot. I also wanted to have a small mouse that I could easily carry in my laptop bag. This"
"OR";"Great teapot,,came in great shape,,and this is so neat to use,,makes just the perfect tea,,and PS,,YOU can use it on a ceramic stovetop"
"OR";"Beautiful musical snowglobe. Very colorful with all the disney characters and great detail. Makes a nice addition to our Christmas treasures."
"OR";"Fantastic! Perfect fit for a divided 55 gallon tank, and the cutout meshes almost exactly with my Marineland Penguin 350 filter. I may buy another to replace the old light on the other side of the tank, because the old light is being completely outshined!"
"OR";"Ms Binchy expresses in the simplest of terms ... The humanness of the ordinary person. It's a fragile embrace that this writer bestows on each character. In a few short words she creates a bond between readers and her characters. She's a lovely writer who seamlessly brings ideals to the forefront."
"OR";"I really enjoyed this story! The character development was very well done. Hoping for another great read from this author."
"OR";"Pretty simple recipes. All can be found online. These are simple, oils & butters only. None that require a preservative or water or emulsfying wax"
"OR";"I bought this because my old clippers were not cutting the nail cleanly. It kind of left the nail ragged. This one is the same as my old pair."
"OR";"Read the God Series. Witness the eternal light of reason. Do the math. Become perfect. Do not live a life of regret."
"OR";"Okay.  Not great, but an enjoyable way to pass on evening.  Captures your attention well, starts fast but drags in the middle."
"OR";"It's slower than the integrated graphics on my HP business desktop from 2004, so don't get it unless you're upgrading something ancient."
"OR";"Got this for winter home to control thermostat from 1800 miles away. It works perfectly! Easy to install and setup."
"OR";"Big, sturdy, comfortable.  No clue what the long skinny pocket on the inside would be for, but it doesn't take away from the bag."
"OR";"Love these for our homeschool classroom and use them DAILY! wonderful tools for physical representation of math concepts and even story starters. good quality and tough enough to stand up to 4 kids, one of which being a toddler and one being autistic. Buying more sets soon."
"OR";"Nice low-cost alternative, but won't stand up to much abuse.  Surprisingly, it did hold up to extensive lateral force without bending, but at the end of hey strenuous day, one section had become jammed so tightly into the one above it I could not get them apart."
"OR";"I USED THESE TO WASH MY WINDOWS AND WHAT SUPER NICE CLOTHS, NOT A BIT OF LINT AND SO HANDY AND WASHES UP GREAT... NOW MY WINDOW SPARKLE..."
"OR";"Have been using on my Maltese for years.  She always smells so good after her bath, and I don't worry about this burning her eyes or skin as it is so gentle."
"OR";"These stories are short, but they could do more even with their limited pages. One sex scene? A rushed climax of confrontation? We can do better."
"OR";"2013-08-04 Update - They worked great for about a month.  Two weeks ago, the one side stopped working. It works at the beginning of the run, the stops after about 2 miles.  It will work again the next day.  I have tried everything.  Once, on a longer run, it did restart towards the end of the run.  "
"OR";"I love this cutting boards as they are sturdy and dishwasher safe.  They do not slip and slide around on the counter top.  Good purchase."
"OR";"I like these mats, makes baking cleanup much easier, they clean in just a second would recommend to buy"
"OR";"Pretty much garbage. The threads only go in a couple turns and will strip out in a matter of a few light whacks. Not worth the money at all."
"OR";"Great lube to have for some places where it's hard to get thicker lubes to penetrate. A little goes a long way."
"OR";"This is the 2nd order.  I returned the 1st order as it was defective as the battery would not hold charge and the battery is not accessible to replace.  This unit works great.  Not in the original packaging and not manual but it as all the cables that came with it originally.  The manual is easily o"
"OR";"I gave this for a Christmas present and my grandson has really enjoyed toting his toy tractors and animals around in it.  It is very convenient for travel."
"OR";"I've tried other products similar to this product but this is by far the one I like the best. It stays on for the right amount of time. It goes on immediately. I can now see the clothes in my closet  at night . I love that and I'm going to order more for the other closets in my home. I don't have to"
"OR";"Really sharp watch - works well for more dressy or casual events - I needed a watch with a very light brown or camel colored band to match belts and shoes I wear and this one does the trick - Timex usually has served me well so I am sure this one will be no different!"
"OR";"Very cool.

It would be so much nicer if the wheels were CBN rather than diamond and also available in fine grits such as 180 and 240.

If they did that it would be perfect.

It does require you to perfect a technique with the right pressure and wrist action, but this isn't hard.  A few goes and its"
"OR";"I've ordered a couple of different type of wired connectors and these are the only ones that seemed to work for my 5050 led strips"
"OR";"I love the price, they work fine. However, there is a slight delay when turning them on. Which is strange for an LED bulb for me. The Cree bulbs do not do this."
"OR";"This is one of the best textbooks that I have had.  Not only is it useful for the class, but it is useful in the real world.  So much that a few classes later, I found that this was of better use than the textbooks that were for the class that I was in.  A comprehensive guide to explain the decision"
"OR";"One of my fav authors who did not disappoint. A great story interwoven with fact. A great read & most entertaining"
"OR";"I have read all the Dragonfury Series and am anxiously awaiting Coreenes next one.  I have enjoyed all her books and recommend you read all of them  ."

"OR";"It fits good and I love the colors!. The size appears to be accurate to me, may be just a touch big, but I like it that way."
"OR";"This item did not work when plugged into my car slot. Tried both my cars and did not work. Wouldn't suggest anyone to waste their time on this."

"OR";"Fits well and met my expectations.  Three stars because I believe these rings are priced at least three times higher than they should be."
"OR";"I have re-read this book several times, it was a really neat story. I bought this as a Kindle daily deal and loved the characters so much I bought the rest of the books in the series. This was an original story line with some great little twists. Sophia James has a hit with these 4 books."
"OR";"I could not put this book down.  Quick paced, intriguing and exciting.  If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book!"

"OR";"60/40 Rosin Core solder is getting harder and harder to find. All I see is mostly that lead free crap which is harder to solder. I don't like it.  I'll stick with good old tried and true 60/40. Simply works the best."

"OR";"This book is likely to make many people very uncomfortable, but I think it's a great alternative version of what is taught in mainstream Christianity.  Mary is brought to life as an individual with weaknesses and foibles, and a historical reality that makes a lot more sense than generally (blindly) "
"OR";"I use it for sous vide an making yoghurt.
Only complaint - when going from 110 for yoghurt to 165 for something else, for example, you press and hold temp change button and it crawls up slowly.  Would have been nice to have a feature other electronics use that accelerates after a delay."
"OR";"I got this for my son for his 8th birthday. He likes to browse Amazon and add things to his wish list, and this was one of the things he found. I'm happy to say it was a great experiment for him and he was able to build it with minimal help from my husband so definitely a 5 star purchase."

"OR";"I didn't want to put these books down, a very creative and interesting read. get all the books in the series, you won't be sorry."
"OR";"Wish there were more uses and more information but, the ones stated are very good. This is quick starter book and well worth the read !"
"OR";"These shelf liners are handy - sized and formed to fit the shelf perfectly!  The reason for four stars and not five is they're a bit thin; that makes them easy for the vendor to pack and send but does raise the question of how durable they'll be.  Other than that concern about durability, just right"
"OR";"A great book, much more detail than the film.
A very sad but true story.
Well worth the read but have the tissues ready.
Philomena was very gracious about her story, there must be a lot of children out there looking for their birth mothers.
Shame on the church , let's hope lessons have been learnt."

"OR";"We used two of these to be able to isolate a shower head and a slide bar handshower without having to buy and an additional diverter valve. They seem to be of high quality and were a fraction of cost of the diverter valve ($275) from Delta. We can have both shower heads on or one at a time."

"OR";"I went to petsmart to get a puppy pen and they were double the price than what amazon offered. Very study and great for putting a puppy/ dog in when you can't keep a eye on them. Only gave it 4 stars because it isn't the easiest thing to fold back together. Otherwise Recommend."
"OR";"I bought this cover for a memory foam mattress I purchased on clearance at Petco.  I am very pleased with the cover, it is very heavy duty and will withstand the abuse from my dogs!

"OR";"Trying to read ""the classics"" I'd pnly read from Comic books, and this was a good but tough read. Language so different from how we speak today and much more ""science"" than I'd anticipated, even though not completely correct with what we know today, but still a good read."

In 175 pages of rather well written prose about a rich woman I could never stand and from the viewpoint of her passive-aggressive attorney husband living in a snobby neighborhood of the famous Gold Coast of west Long Island, New York, let me t"
"OR";"I do love it. It's well-made and compact, but seems like a bottom-less pit. I've only used domestically so far this year, but it goes international in February and will get a workout. It's all I plan to take for a 10 day ski trip and jaunt to Venice -  well, and a purse and backpack."
"OR";"NUMBER OF HEARTS: 4
As always Ms. Shalvis has given me a story that I fell head over heels in love with. I also love that we have a new series and a new cast of characters for fall in love with. I am already looking forward to the next two installments in this series. But back to Sweet Little Lies.

"OR";"This is so much longer on me than the model. I'm 5'7'' and tried both the white and the green but both are below my knees. Definitely not what it looks like on the model"
"OR";"Disappointed that you can only use up to a 40 watt bulb.  Not nearly bright enough for over my island.  I've ordered something different."
"OR";"A very interesting movie.
The main problem I had was the musical score blaring over the dialogue. At times it was impossible to understand what the actors were saying."
"OR";"Interesting at best. Lot of truth to this book. Would recommend it to others. Once I started reading I could not stop"
"OR";"I like the way the case works... just slip in the shotgun and fold over the end.

And it can be used as a life preserver... for your shotgun."
"OR";"this is a great pan. I have had 3 in the last 20 years. highly recommend. I would recommend and All-Clad products."
"OR";"Nothing could be easier. You just plug it into the wall socket, plug in the lamp, and you are done. That's it. Nothing more! It even has a small light so that you can find it in the dark. We hang ours on the edge of the head board. No more fumbling around. It even has a slider for dimming. We bought"
"OR";"I was disappointed in this.  Maybe it's just my cats but they could of cared less when I sprayed it on things.  I will try something else next time."
"OR";"Classic animated film from my childhood. The new deleted scenes were refreshing as well. The movie feels shorter now than it did as a child."
"OR";"great fan and works well in my small bathroom...... so quiet... like a previous post.. my wall was about 6.5 Inches thick, does require cutting with snips the metal that allows the junction box to fit in.. not a deal breaker, but does take a little work to fix..."
"OR";"I always like a good western romance to read and this one did not dissapoint..  It was a bit predictable, but I enjoyed it at any rate."
"OR";"I bought this item so I could hook it up to my camcorder to get the audio from the convention on FM and eliminate the crowd noise (Babies crying, high heel noise, etc.)  It works perfectly.  I bought two of them so I could monitor the recording and still be mobile."
"OR";"Needed to sharpen those left hand drill bits and the drill Dr is such a good machine that I figured I might as well do them on it."
"OR";"Great costume.  This thing is as silly as it looks.  I went out with a group on a bar crawl this past Halloween, and we had 10 of us wearing this same costume, it was a hit.  The only tip I'd give you is to stuff the eyes and tails with some newspaper, since they are just unsupported pieces of fabri"
"OR";"I bought an xl for our 115 lbs Doberman. I first got him a large which he can wear but it doesn't fully cover his back and the underbelly strap is a snug fit. The xl is perfect! Our terrier also has one of these coats. They are thick and of excellent quality and with a reasonabale price."
"OR";"These are the best nerf darts. They are easy to find andd to keep track of. They go far, but they are soft and don't hurt."
"OR";"Terrible product. Fits well, but just not enough cushion to stop noises of a chair being puled in and out of it's place at the dinner table."
"OR";"I like it.  Nothing to extravagant.  It catches the drops that usually eventually smell.  I haven't had it long, but I wish i had bought it sooner."
"OR";"These are high quality, durable and nice to have so many of them!!  11 month old granddaughter loves them.  Highly recommend."
"OR";"If you need a 3way swivel then these are the ones. No tangles even in strong current. Can be used instead of tying a dropper loop."

"OR";"Well written! I enjoyed it very much and will read more by I H Laking. Intriguing new steampunk  world and characters."
"OR";"Looks good and secure. However opening cut out for screen just a little bit small. So when you try to use touch screen functions its a little tight to get to those sections. A place for a stylist would have been a plus and a slot in the back for your hand when using as a reader."
"OR";"Color is very pale pink, material is very soft. Held through the wash and dry cycle perfectly. The pillow design is as pictured."
"OR";"I have no complaints with this HDMI cable. Tripp Lite products are really starting to impress me in their quality  and performace of their products. Thanks."

Highly recommend. Quick read."
"OR";"I bought this for my grandson last year for Christmas, with a little help for a 2 year old he got a kick out of it."
"OR";"Very convenient, but like a purse, you just want more storage. It did come off during storage of my folding knee scooter, but it was easy to put back on."
"OR";"I thought the writing was entertaining and very genuine but not mature enough.  I couldn't wait to finish the book .... I had to scan through the last few pages."
"OR";"Interesting and strong female character for those times and how lucky we are living in times of so many choices of pain killers for our ills."
"OR";"really nice quality drop cloths. I'm using mine as a removable side for the pergola. I love it."
"OR";"I bought mainly to pocket carry my Springfield XDS but pocket carry can be difficult depending on the pants I have on. But, the holster works great IWB. No clip needed and not fear of it sliding down. Somehow it just stays put. I guess that's why its called the sticky holsters."
"OR";"My husband likes the fit and that it is higher fit. He just wishes that the material was a little thicker. These are a lot better than other brands."
"OR";"A MUST READ WOW!! A private island, two sexy men ,some really hot sex what more could you ask for ?"

"OR";"I installed these in my dining room ceiling fan. They worked great with the existing dimmer switch. They are brighter than the incandescents we replaced, but the color and quality of the light is very similar. I like the extra brightness during the daytime.

"OR";"She loved how interesting and different the setting was to the original top tier, including the floating guy's feet and the bendy tree!"
"OR";"I teach with this. Many excellent selections. Pretty good on how to write about lit. Well-made sample essays on the stories and poems. I just miss the study questions - but then, having to come up with my own is a learning challenge! The price is wonderful too. Also, the book holds up well with many"
"OR";"WOW, WOW, WOW.  I Tried to give it half a star but was unable to.  The cinematography was cheesy as well as the acting.  Wow really bad.  I couldn't get past how poorly made this was to finish watching it.  Too bad......the cover showed so much promise."
"OR";"The slippers I bought my granddaughter were too small.  The exchange could not have been any easier.  Sophie loves the look and feel of the shoe."
"OR";"Perfect for my intended use. I did not purchase this for anything camera related but rather for my Nintendo 2DS with the Trigger Grip. It fits perfectly and even allows room in the other compartment for 3DS folding headphones and charger. A complete travel pack for my 2DS and accessories."

"OR";"very very very wonderful book . I have also finished the series and I have to say that it was one of the best series I've ever read"
"OR";"His message is clear. Very inspiring. Deliberately repetitive, which I find helpful. Must read for anyone who desires to do big things."
"OR";"This toy lasted until my puppy entered her destructive teenager phase, and it was one of her favorites. The squeakers are sewn in snugly and provided tons of entertainment for my mutt. Great fun as long as your pup doesn't enjoy ripping toys to shreds like mine does."
"OR";"Great show, Wahlberg and Tom Selleck are both great actors.  Among other great actors and actresses in this crime show."
"OR";"Not bad, but could easily have been developed into a longer book. Just finishing the incomplete sentences would have lengthened the story!"
"OR";"right out of the box light was ready to go gave away to inlaws for presents light up your porch dramatically at night !!!"
"OR";"It is almost the perfect craft light.  The lights are great and so is the magnification.  The lights circle the viewer so it well distributed light.  It doesn't tend to tip over like some of them do.  The neck is just like it shows not a snake neck so is not the best for some situations.  But given "

"OR";"Tried to install it, didn't work with my GPU as advertised. Oh well, thanks for accepting my return though, Puget."
"OR";"Easy to install. Allows for better recoil control. It will significantly increase the grip diameter however. Not for small hands."
"OR";"It's definitely a cute watch and I love the color a lot. However, it is too loud!!!!!! I could hear it when I wear it to sleep."
"OR";"3-pack flexibiliy fits and seals wet cat food cans wonderfully.  Hard to find in stores.  Very pleased."
"OR";"It's beautiful! Well constructed . The picture doesn't do it justice. If you work at it, you could fit a queen size pillow in it."
"OR";"A little large compared to others but works great. HD-SDI plus Video outputs, makes it versatile."
"OR";"It was really hard to see and find a message in this story. In one of the scenes it really seemed like a porno."
"OR";"Way too many superfluous F bombs, but an interesting story and decent actors, lots of sci fi action"
"OR";"This is a great concept, however the holes do not fit 7-strand paracord.  It is frustrating when it arrives and you realize that you have to drill out the holes to fit."
"OR";"This blender is excellent!  Engineered well and built well.  I have used a lot of blenders in my life but this one really blends whatever you toss into it. If the lid is not secured properly it will not start (nice feature)!  Lots of power = lots of noise...this has both.  Also, this lower blade is "

"OR";"Very good fit. It's not as light weight as I expected which is good and bad depending on the weather. Irons easy and well."
"OR";"I'm pretty impressed with this litter trap mat. The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the ma"
"OR";"I thought this selection was the best of all my robot purchases for my grandson.  I have not learned the results of his use or playtime with the Tin Can Robot, but I like it."
"OR";"My dog took zero interest in this nylabone. I think it's just too hard for her. She likes the softer ones that have a ""chicken"" flavor."
"OR";"It was merely okay. Too many unanswered questions, lengthy stretches without any meaningful  action. You never know why he was sailing alone for one thing. I watched all the way through thinking something meaningful was going to pop up but it never showed. Compelling but incomplete."
"OR";"My little guy doesn't have to feel scared any more! He feels comfortable when he sprays this! Easy to refill with choice air freshener!"
"OR";"This was just what I needed --
Very pleased with the quality of the construction --
FLAT design keeps the ""bulk"" of round/snake-like extension cords --
Buy with confidence !!!

"OR";"I received this book as an ARC .  I love the Annihilate Me Series.  Tank and Lisa story was incredible, and this is just the beginning.  Omg the sex scenes.  I can't wait for the next volume.  Christina Ross your one hella of writer.  .keep it up.  I need more please.  You left me hanging."
"OR";"The stitching around the thumb is in a really weird spot and it makes them incredibly uncomfortable. Thin and comfortable enough but I had to return them"
"OR";"The book is fine, but the DVD was not included, so the seller refunded me instead of sending the DVD. I had to go buy a DVD elsewhere."
"OR";"Great cheap pots. Dishwasher safe (no nasty exterior coating like other pots) Good nonstick interior all the way to the rim. Doesn't chip easily. I got two and use them both several times throughout the week. They are a great size and do whatever job I throw at them. I am going to subtract 1 star (a"
"OR";"I do like it. It works well. The complaints I have about it are relatively minor:
1) It does use quite a bit of space. To keep the arms from extending beyond the back of my desk (which was important in my particular setting), I had to mount it (drill the hole) almost 12"" in from the back edge of the"
"OR";"Amazing read. The humor,the wit and the amazing insights to everyday issues. Sign me up for any book MR Robertson writes."
"OR";"This guy is amazing! He can transform himself right in the middle of battle from vehicle to soldier, and back again. Apparently he can do the job of 10 soldiers. I don't doubt it!  The colors and 'feel' of the Autobot Hound add to the fun. The manufacturers made choices that make him seem authentic."
"OR";"Fantastic bag! I looked at and purchased a few other laptop bags from Samsonite, Incase, etc. and nothing comes close to this. They use YKK zippers, have multiple pockets with soft lining to not scratch up laptops, iPads, etc. and this case has plenty of pockets but not too many!"
"OR";"I got one last April and like it so well I bought another. Might even get another!"
"OR";"5-Star. Well written, excellent story line, characters interesting. Must-read for book lovers who likes to follow main characters beyond the first book. Highly recommend, suspenseful , hard to put down once start reading. 5-star rated all 3 books"
"OR";"Good to read  interesting to see how they both fought being in love with each other. Women should always get a second opinion about their health."
"OR";"Who doesn't like Christmas or romance or great looking guys or smart beautiful leading ladies  This book has it all"
"OR";"Pretty creepy movie, but good. I had never heard of it but my ex-husband insisted we watch it. I'm glad we did it was good."
"OR";"First pocket knife for our son, who is 11.  It made a great gift when he crossed over into Boy Scouts - he loves it!"
"OR";"These glasses have been great. They have a nice weight and the design is interesting without being flashy or gaudy. We use them for whiskey, yum."
"OR";"chopped a half cup of walnuts 3 times, the button broke. a piece of trash great when it ran tho."
"OR";"From a review I read I expected a lot more; then I looked at the price and realized I got just what I paid for: inferior product at best."
"OR";"An excellent treat that is good for dental health and enjoyed by your dog. Was priced great and prompt shipemnnt and delivery."
"OR";"this is not the worst zombie movie some good makeup but not so good cgi if u have nothing to do or with some friends getting drunk"

"OR";"Excellent place to buy fast delivery, item as illustrated, and good price, is what we all expect when making a purchase."
"OR";"I bought this cage for my Holland lop. Fantastic size for him with lots of extra room for him to play. The only negative I have is the bottom of the cage has a raised square textured patturn that makes it very difficult to clean out messes - especially urine. Other than that - this cage is superior "
"OR";"It fits correctly , it comes out without frictions,
 I hope it lasts, if not I'll let you guys know

"OR";"Nice upgrade for the peltor head sets. Just replace the batteries with this unit and recharge off your USB port. Long lasting too."
"OR";"I wish they filled their cans more. And the quality doesn't match Friskies, but the food does have a stronger smell to it and you can tempt a stuffed up kitty with it."
"OR";"Did a 'kayamping' trip, took this along and had privacy for side of the river stops. It folds up great and flat, stored out of the way."
"OR";"Used these on my stainless steel fridge to mount my iPad 1.  No cover.  Has held just fine for 7 months already."
"OR";"We had 3 of these someone gave us for xmas, or wtvr a long time ago.  So we tossed them on the survival shelf, why not right...

"OR";"I adore this. I'm not entirely sure why, I just know it strikes me as intelligent and forward and I love the varied perspectives and how clear and vivid they all are."
"OR";"I sampled the book, then bought it. I found Scott Adams insights and experience match what I've seen work.

I marked it up for my youngest son, just starting out as an adult. Then I bought two more copies - one for oldest son, and another to replace mine. Adams' style is accessible and clear.

"OR";"This is an interesting though flawed revisionist take on the on-going battle between angels and demons. Add in a further fictionalized Frankenstein monster (aka Adam) to the mix and the result is a rip-roaring actionfest with some strains of prophecy and fantasy. It is not bad for what it is - a fea"
"OR";"I have completed another Jack Ryan storey.  He  never disappoints and I was very impressed  with young Jack Jr and his buddies from the Campus crew. May Mr Clancy rest in peace and God bless his family. It has a 5 star rating in my opinion."

"OR";"Bought this as a last hope for my leather coat... did a great job made the coat look great and was not stiff."
"OR";"The dog clothes are all the wrong sizes like 1 small is for a teacup and another small is a small so u have to order a large for a small or a extra large for a small it gets very confusing and they don't honor exchanges I've got burned 6 times"
"OR";"Nice display. But the side buttons press too easily.  The band that holds the extra  strap down doesn't stay in place."
"OR";"Somewhat sad to finish volume 3. Hard to get anything else done when I was so engrossed in this amazing story."
"OR";"This is so much what can happen when things get tough, even in a Christian marriage.  Thanks for tackling a tough subject, and doing it well."
"OR";"I loved this cooker, but it inexplicably went dead in the middle of a cycle after just two years of light use.  Given the cost of the item, I am not pleased.  Worse, this failure occurred abruptly after a spendy repair to the steam valve.

Before the failure, I found the device to make reliable rice"
"OR";"Was so very disappointed by this purchase! These rocks are TINY!!!!! Seriously like half the size of a dime!
Got them for my 4 yr old as a Christmas gift- ended up being a stocking stuffer bc so small and they were lost almost immediately- I repeat tiny TINY rocks!!!!!"

"OR";"I downloaded the book Christmas Eve an I have time to read it. Well through out the book even the bonus books have a red ! Saying click here error in your download. Well the book seemed to download fine. But I am worried it has a virus so I am not going to read it. I just thought someone should know"
"OR";"Just getting back into the game after being away for a while due to knee replacement. This book should be on every golfer's book shelf."
"OR";"To be going through so much Im glad that Farrah prayers were finally answered. Caisen was god sent the way he stepped up and showed her different. Nick and Asia they rode hard for their family. Nia as the saying goes hurt people hurt people..."
"OR";"I love that the kids can create sandwiches and pocket sandwiches with these flexible, felt foods.  It's not just plastic food that is put on a plate."
"OR";"This is a high quality robe. It is very similar to the ones sold in the Universal stores. It has the inside wand pocket too! It was just perfect. No complaints."
"OR";"I really enjoyed reading this story in the Shifter Wonderland boxed set.  I thought it was a riot even though I haven't seen an ugly Christmas sweater yet.

If you like bear shifters and Christmas stories you will love this one.  Grab yourself a copy and you will be happy that you did."
"OR";"Love this shoe!  Size is perfect, color is exactly what I wanted for spring.  Even my fashionista daughter liked these!!"
"OR";"I bought this for my 12 month old niece and she LOVES it!!!! It's almost as tall as her but she can still carry it around everywhere. I like that his feet and head are adjustable so we can always make him stand up. I only wish it were another 6-12"" bigger....but that's ok. We'll keep it for sure!"
"OR";"Solved the problems of all those little ""transformer plugs"" that seem to be on everything nowadays!! And take up the space of TWO regular plugs!"
"OR";"Great alternative to the expensive name-brand version. Works really well on 2 fat, incredibly-sheddy orange tabbies. I don't really use the button/lever to get the hair off, but appreciate the option. I get so much off of the cats that it's easier and more satisfying to pull it off by hand."
"OR";"I had bought a monitor and it never did 4K with the display cord I had. I then bought these and now 4K works on that monitor. Will keep buying these for our office."
"OR";"I recommend this book to those who are looking for a good, quick read without raunchy love scenes. This story was well developed and the chemistry between the two main characters was realistic. Supporting characters didn't overwhelm the plot and each of them fit into the story nicely. Worth your tim"
"OR";"I like this series so far.  On to the next book  in the Virgil Flowers series.  Hoping the momentum doesn't stop."
"OR";"Purchased as a gift for my Sister in law- she was really excited when she received it, and plans to begin the devotional right away. I am happy with it too!"
"OR";"I liked it. It was a good funny movie. I saw at the theater unlike most of the negative critics on here that watch a trailer and seem to think they know a lot. You will like it if you like good acting. If you like bad actors like Robert Downey or Ben Stiller you will not like it."
"OR";"Simple and effective. Way easier to use than other tools used for the same thing and it takes up virtually no space. I love it."
"OR";"We previously had the Tetra Waterfall Globe which was pretty, until the extremely thin glass shattered in my hands during a cleaning. So... enter our new tank (and new fish, sadly our old betta met an unfortunate - not tank related - end)...

"OR";"Great statue. The detail, colors and textures are perfect. The base is amazing...love that it is a street. Definitely getting Catwoman's."
"OR";"This stuff is great. Cleans everything well and doesn't leave any residue. I only use this stuff and probably will forever! All you need is this and an oil like Eezox or whatever you like. Then maybe some lube like gun butter or whatever you like to use. I put that s*** on everything"
"OR";"Haven't used it yet so can't comment on it.  Bought it for my dog who has car sickness, but I use the Wondershirt and that works."
"OR";"I love these shoes...

I love it the way they conform to your feet...  to be a custom fit!

Great shoes!

Very reasonable shipping too!"
"OR";"As a stand-alone book, The Long Earth takes its time getting started, which may put off Pratchett's usual audience. The thing is, it's not a stand-alone. It's the first half of a 2-part series, which may explain they very many apparently random events and characters and why the ending feels so odd: "
"OR";"I use this every day to keep my lunches chilled. It is large enough to hold a couple blue ice blocks along with a sealed bowl of my meal. It seems to be well made. It is much better than the plastic bags I had been using to carry my food to the office."
"OR";"This item came in perfect condition, and was just as described. My kids all fought over who was going to get to keep this one it's so cute."
"OR";"GO TO  PLAY STORE TYPE IN  PSTEC  8 MIN TO GET RID OF A BAD MEMORIE  YOU WONT BELIEVE IT"
"OR";"light weight and function as intended.  But I'm not sure if I carry it again as it's rather big n occupy space in the backpack"
"OR";"great, wish it was a foot or 2 longer since the washer connector on the left and the dryer (steam) on the opposite side"
"OR";"Pros: pretty easy to install, delivers a nice stream of water, good spray pressure, feels sturdy after install, can do the handle left or right, color I wanted. Cons: almost returned because its super tall and clunky looking (not rustic, but not refined), the pull down nozzle does not pull out or re"
"OR";"Not individually packaged with celaphane wrap like others are. The price is good and so far they seem to work well."
"OR";"This is a great product - the timer ability sets it apart from average. Unfortunately, we purchased cool white, not realizing we needed warm white to match what we already have.  Still, this is a nice little light set and we'll find a way to use it in another setting."
"OR";"I've used this item to make boilded eggs for about a year now with great success. It seems so simple yet so wonderful. I used to time my eggs, but I have found this to be more reliable, especially for soft. It's easy to overcook a soft-boiled egg and this little thing is surprisingly accurate."
"OR";"My kitty doesn't care at all for the bug, and the wire is much too stiff, so we put bird feathers on it and he will play with it from time to time."
"OR";"it's perfect for my 7 year old son, but you have to take the case off in order to plug in the charger.  all in all, I got what I paid for."
"OR";"These are excellent filters and do a great job. Water tastes very good after going thru these filters then filtered further in a filtering water pitcher. Which I highly recommend. These filters are great when filtering for general water usage is done. But I recommend further filtering for drinking w"
"OR";"Use with Thetford Curve. MUCH easier to use and carry extras than the liquid. No odor, no mess, and one small pouch dropped into the lower (black) tank with a little water is all that's needed to activate. Had never used this product or a port-a-potty before and both were a breeze!"
"OR";"Very easy to use.  I plugged the unit into the ethernet jack, ran the configuration utility, and it was visible / accessible to Windows 10 and Android devices.  The DLNA feature works well, allowing me to stream stored videos directly to my LG Smart TV."
"OR";"Great product that arrived in good condition.  Dogs benifit from these bones making their teeth tarter free!"
"OR";"I will be ordering more of this product. It is small enough to give to smaller dogs, (Jack Russells) but large enough to be more than a gobble."
"OR";"This movie precedes ""Lord of the Rings"" movies...we really liked it. I think you would like it if you liked Lord of the Rings"
"OR";"Do you like Anime? Do you like South Park?

Combine the offensive material of South Park and the weirdness of Anime and this is what you get.

Any anime fan will love this series. Trust me. You'll be weirded out at first (I was) but once you start laughing you won't stop watching this show."
"OR";"Easy to read. Key words and terms are clearly defined. Author begins with the constitution rather than the history if government."
"OR";"Well it was a waste of money for me. The opening was too small and if you have any length on your nails FORGET it! Lost the opal ball immediately. Frustrating."
"OR";"For once, I did know the mystery since the beginning (I'm not usually that good), even if I didn't know who was the culprit. But to me, that wasn't a spoiling of the enjoyment of reading the story, cause there were many points I deeply appreciated, two out of them, the love story and the setting.

"OR";"Another Beatrix Potter character that I love from her stories.  Soft and cuddly and lovable for the grandchildren to love also."
"OR";"I saw this item on a Bobby Flay cooking show.... During commercial, I ordered it, so I can enjoy making mixed drinks..... Awesome......"
"OR";"The brown boot is ok just wished I had ordered black. It's a little tight around the front of the foot. Overall it's ok."
"OR";"Very difficult to get playdough out of the cutters even for adult fingers. Not a product my preschooler can play with alone without frustration."
"OR";"Too darn tight!  This is not made for adults; they are made for children!  Unless you weight 90 lb with no meat on your bones, these will not fit."
"OR";"Quick read. Worth the download, but glad it was free. Really nothing special here, but nothing particularly wrong with it, either."
"OR";"Nicholas Bella has created a magnificent
world in The New Haven Series!  Guaranteed
once you start reading you won't want to stop!"
"OR";"Fit my 9' 6"" walden like a glove. Nice appearance and material. Would recomend and buy from again.."
"OR";"For the money this slider is really smooth. I just received this item today (which is earlier then I anticipated). I have been playing with this item ever since."
"OR";"The second season dvd-set is a great improvement over the first. The best special feature was the season two gag reel."
"OR";"Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright continue to prove that power corrupts. Other characters have their own agendas and the conflict is great to watch."
"OR";"wow, what a fab read, I was hooked from the first page. the story is fast paced from the beginning till the very last page. this story was full of suspense which moved the story along well. the characters and story line were really well written
 highly recommended"
"OR";"The Dell USB 3.0 Dual Display Universal Dock D1000 is sleek, compact, and works very well.  Having used past Dell USB docks, I can say this new model does not come with the compatibility issues of prior versions.  The ability to utilize dual displays, plus it's compactness make it a great option on "
"OR";"cups came chipped and missing blue coating.  I ordered 6 and two were chipped.  The others are very poorly made."
"OR";"Great Case For The Money, Protects Like No Other,  Gets a lot of looks, Just a bit big.  Perfect for your bag."
"OR";"Well made, but shape isn't ideal for larger ears. Also they do not nest together, which would have been nice."
"OR";"I love all her books! Her characters are worm and funny and totally lovable. These stories are heartfelt and satisfying! Read them all If you can!"
"OR";"I was so excited to see this Toy back on the market. This adorable huggable breathing Golden Retriever Puppy was very popular back 6 or 7 years ago. It was a gift to me from my husband, but my little 3 year old Grand-daughter was fascinated with just

"OR";"Its so fun to watch my kids engage with this DVD and learn another language. It works amazingly and they are learning to talk with there hands"
"OR";"I understand this is the beginning of a new series. I will read the next book but the start is not as good as the Odd Thomas series."
"OR";". . . will enjoy this wonderful movie.  Sweet, comical, creative, touching.  SIt is such a delight to watch something that is truly entertaining."
"OR";"It's hard to say what the best part of this story is. The characters were so lovable and believable.  Hope there are more books by Giselle Green."
"OR";"I got this for a crate pad but ended up using it as a play mat for my puppy. She loves it; it is sort of like her home base in the house. She plays on it, sleeps on it, chews on it, etc. It is her little place. Will use it for a crate pad as she gets bigger but it is perfect for a play mat now."
"OR";"Attractive, comfortable compression sock in a therapeutic compression level.  They have worked well both at work for 12 hour shifts and during airplane rides, when I tend to swell.  Price point is much more reasonable than similar socks sold on nursing supply websites."
"OR";"Great collection of recipes. Do we need anything else? Loved the photos too. Defiantly a keeper or great gift."
"OR";"grandson loves them and that is all that matters with  me. they seem rather light weight. don't know yet how well they will hold up."
"OR";"I really liked this, but keep in mind this type of tubing floats and cannot be used without some sort of anchor in ATO situations."
"OR";"Was actually a lot more solid then I thought it was going to be.  If I need another one down the road I would re-order this one."
"OR";"Pretty, but dents and scratches easily.  I have placed this in an area where there is very little traffic, and it is still dented.  The wood seems soft."
"OR";"Bought this for the sleeper couch in our RV.  It's pretty thin but still seems to work great and it stores beneath the couch so it's out of the way.  It hasn't been tried out for a full night's sleep yet.  The cover and straps are nice.  It's almost a perfect fit, just a tad short."
"OR";"I own a 2005 Cadillac CTS with a Bose system. If I were Bose, I would be ashamed to put my name on it as the factory speakers suck so badly.

"OR";"I haven't tried it out yet but it seems nice and durable. It is fifty feet of red rope and can hold 30 Lbs."
"OR";"This was a gift for my daughter and she LOVED it!! She loved the colors and patterns as well as the different sizes. As a mom I am happy to get anything to keep those creative juices flowing...this was a win win product! I got this set and the Cool tape colors for my other daughter... they couldn't "

"OR";"Good case.  Better than expected.  Strongly recommend.  Would definitely buy again.  Believe this to be a sound purchase."

"OR";"Good effects and some decent acting.
I enjoyed watching the movie even though I am not young (not by a long way)."
"OR";"Girls (3 and 5) LOVE these books. This one is very detail oriented and they love the pictures. I was actually surprised at how long it was! We also have the Narnia book and it is much shorter (one small paragraph per page), so I was quite impressed with the length of this one! Definitely recommend."
"OR";"As usual, Ms. Buroker delivers an action packed and yet thought provoking tale.  Now, on to enjoy  her next story!"
"OR";"So disappointed. I had one of these for 10 years until it finally broke.  I purchased this one and it broke as soon as I used it.  The design is flimsy and cheap.  The batteries fell out and the top doesn't stay put.  Night and day from the same make that I had for 10 years.  Must be made in China n"
"OR";"Works great..But once your kid gets this one moded to fit his elbow...DO NOT let anyone else wear it.."
"OR";"Bought these to use for my cooking oils to keep the containers cleaner for pouring and not making a mess in my cabinets and I love them!"
"OR";"I use it for watering my garden from the creek in the back yard and it works excellent.  easy to use and easy to set up."
"OR";"Worked well for 2 days and then the dial wouldn't get but one station, slipped or IDK :(  Am returning."
"OR";"This is not a movie I ever think about when I'm looking for something to watch, but over the years I've watched it two or three times and I always enjoy it. There's nothing outstanding about it; it's not a unique plot, the acting is so-so - but for some reason none of that hurts it's watchability. I"
"OR";"excellent bins!!!  I bought 8!  stacked them for 4 high for travel items for trips, cruises--and the other stack was for my many purses---everything is now sorted and so easy to get to.  Even stacked, these are strong, stable and just perfect for an organized closet, laundry room or garage."

"OR";"Solid metal materials. Pretty easy to assemble. Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. All of his shoes fit nicely!"
"OR";"Expensive, interesting because it magnified cool things, but after a week it sat unused on the floor for months. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
"OR";"too long in the body, very very tight  and prefer a higher cut leg.  item fine, just my personal taste.
item returned."
"OR";"Who in their right mind would ever try to fit a pool ball in their mouth?? But i like how the stories connect."
"OR";"It is nice to have some color to add to my wardrobe.  Comfortable fit, just like the one that came with my Fitbit flex 2."
"OR";"I use this switch to turn on blue led strip lighting in my garage.  I have it set up so whenever the opener light is on, this switch is on.  It really helps light up the garage when i enter and leave.  Plus its really cool that i can control this switch from my phone with the myQ app."

"OR";"We have had this for a year which is a pretty good length of time for a bath toy in our house. My boys got this as a gift from a friend for Christmas in 2014. It came without the suction cups to attach it, but I have  a textured tub so it  probably wouldn't have worked anyway. One of my sons has pla"

Is not worth that money.

"OR";"Works as advertised!  The only adapter of its kind that I've been able to find.  Seems to rely on an internal one-way valve to do its magic."
"OR";"I just received my package and when I unscrewed the lid the seal was ripped and there was no scoop. My kitty has IBD and was really wanting to get her started on this."
"OR";"I really enjoyed reading about the rivalry between the cousins.  The book was very interesting if you like history.  I couldn't stop reading it."

"OR";"Arrived on time and in good condition.  This flashlight is much brighter than the other LED type flashlights I now have around the house.  Pleased."
"OR";"Though baby would get bored with this - but not so.  Took two legs off for sitting activity - now standing and it is an activity table."
"OR";"A little twist to the classical game.  Our kids love playing this over and over.  The first game to come down from the shelf when we have friends over."
"OR";"Works well.  Not a carpet ""stretcher"" but a decent option for carpet repair or re-stretching.  I wouldn't recommend this tool for a new install, but I used it to re-attach my carpet to the tac strip after pulling it up.  I had to run some wires around the room and that required pulling up the carpet"
"OR";"I put this book down after reading first few chapters... you won't believe how arrogant and cocky he sounds even in his writing!"

It has a good range and never skipped a beat.
No fuss and no complaint."
"OR";"genre: paranormal romance

"OR";"The butterfly dangles on the chain rather than having another ring to connect to. As a result, the butterfly will hang sideways. It's not a big deal, all you have to do is turn it but still, I was expecting it to hang straight as a typical necklace would. Other than that, no complaints! Its on a lon"
"OR";"Works as described with a Samsung Galaxy S3 but as long as you plug into a wall charger.  Used it on a now 52"" legacy Sony XBR LCD TV & a new Pioneer LED LCD monitor TV at work via one of its HDMI inputs."
"OR";"For the price paid it is a good quality pillow. It was a little smaller than the claimed 18x18 dimensions. But other than that is was worth the money."
"OR";"fantastic knife, very sharp strong and light weight. I just wish them made a partially serrated version with the wave feature."
"OR";"This is a really cute movie. It can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. Well worth the time and money to buy!"
"OR";"Love that it clips on so easily.  Only problem is that I wish it were bigger so my Samsung phone would fit into it without squeezing it in."
"OR";"The length of the arms and legs were a little shorter than I expected a 6x to fit.  But nice quality and great value."
"OR";"New insights into the USA command structure vs. what the Brits wanted in the Pacific. Ditto the Japanese command. Toll integrates the macro and micro very well. Very revealing the enormous USA industrial capacity as the USA ramps up the Navy in the Pacific."
"OR";"Can't say if it works or not because my cat refused to open her mouth and I got a good scratching when I tried to make her."
"OR";"There is nothing better than Filipino food in my eyes and this recipe book is awesome!  I have always wanted to learn how to cook a lot of this stuff but just never took the time to learn. This book is a simple guide full of great recipes and really teaches you step by step."
"OR";"Archangel Zach is a quick paranormal read that I found to be interesting and enjoyable.  The plot is solid and the writing is strong and descriptive.  The author has created an engaging world where there are human angels on earth with special powers as well as the Archangels from the Angelic Realm. "
"OR";"I love this item.  It is very light weight.  And I think the product will serve well while I'm riding my gold wing."
"OR";"I like the way Isla proved her courage.  I also like the flow of the words.
congratulations your book was very nice"
"OR";"While Case intends their knives to be pocketknives, they have the quality and look of a fine collectable. The Stockman model gives you 3 good blades of varying size and shape.  The large version weighs an ounce and a half more than the medium size and is 5/8 of an inch longer.  The additional size a"
"OR";"I've tried a lot of outer-eye fit goggles and after a few months, these are the best. Great water-tight fit without cranking the straps too tight, so they're comfortable for a whole workout. I retreat with anti-fog every couple weeks, and they've stay perfectly clear."
"OR";"The Taotronics Bike Phone Mount Bicycle Holder is a great peace of engineering, that is very versatile. Prior to buying the phone mount holder I placed my phone in a bum bag, when riding my road bike. The Taotronics phone mount holder has enabled me to change all this. Now my phone is mounted on my "
"OR";"I had seen other people wearing these shoes and really liked the strap design. I'm extremely happy with the comfort and the look...nice alternative if you want to deviate from a regular old flip flop. I usually wear a 9 1/2, I ordered a 10 and it fits well."
"OR";"I bought these socks for my husband.  He is a runner and is outside all the time.  He sweats a lot and it is very damp where we live all the time.  His feet were always squishing in cotton socks and his socks were nasty in the laundry.  He insisted on his thick cotton Thorlo socks because they had p"
"OR";"I'm no prude but these stories or what pass for stories were just plain crude and disgusting. Not worth reading even if they are free."
"OR";"Great story, well written. Very authentic depiction of the neighborhoods; especially comes alive if you know the locations."
"OR";"I thought these would be easier than soldering.  I was wrong.  If you can solder, you should get a better connection and save yourself the money of buying these connectors."
"OR";"I loved the book it was straight crazy. I never expected it to end the way that i did.it was crazy that everyone dies"
"OR";"They are so nice and very comfy. I've been having back issues and the orthotics helped so much. Love them I want another pair."
"OR";"This comes in very handy if you need to use a lightbulb in an extension cord for going underneath a house dark crawl space."

"OR";"This was a gift for my Grandson at Easter. It was go with the Bruder conveyer belt which was also given to him at the same time. He relly enjoyed dumping his ""gold nuggets"" onto the conveyer from the dumper and loading his Bruder dump truck.  I am always pleased with the items i order from Bruder."
"OR";"Five stars it moves fast is clear and concise on what is important.  The only bad thing is it leaves you wanting more. IT IS TOO DARN SHORT."
"OR";"Great fit. Love the camo! And the mesh is very nice quality. Always happy with condor purchases."
"OR";"These Frankford caliber specific trays are awesome! The trays are about 25% smaller than a universal tray making it much easier to navigate a drop powder loader for 50 rounds. I now have one of theses for ever caliber I reload and have thrown out the universal ones."
"OR";"Appears to work as described.  We put a battery in it, turned it on and set it out.  So far our dog has not ventured into the room we closed off.  The device makes a loud noise and she does not like loud noises.  I believe this will be fine for our uses, may buy a longer one for additional room."
"OR";"Was disappointed in the twist shifters and response from the stock brake levers on my daughters bike so I bought these as a replacement and they are very nice. No complaints."
"OR";"Tie down's for your tarp broke or you lost or left them behind, tie down that Buck you bagged ? This paracord will work and well !"

"OR";"It is thin but holds much. I bought the tan color, it is a little darker than it looked on my monitor but I like it better"
"OR";"Not a Ka-Bar knife but a Bud-K. I should know. I bought one a few years ago. Great for cosplay or Halloween party."
"OR";"I bought these for a gift. The recipient loved them. Apparently it is hard to find the half sizes in stores with this shoe. No complaints with these."
"OR";"I'm the type of person who, when I find a brand and style I like, I stick with them. My problem was my usual brand has been lacking in quality as of late. for the past 3 years, I was going through them very quickly. It was probably due to the frequent washings but I was having to replace them yearly"
"OR";"I was thoroughly impressed with this book and have found myself returning to use it as a reference time and time again. The information is comprehensive, and there's no doubt that Donna Hardin know's what she's talking about.

I highly recommend this for anyone interested in learning more about deto"
"OR";"This is a very cute lego. I got him to go with a LOTRs set. He goes well with the set. I tried to put the cape over his arms, but my husband figured out it goes over his neck, before his head goes on. The little hands rotate, making him very easy to pose. He should hold up to years of playtime."
"OR";"Broke 2nd use. Don't waste your money. Cap wouldn't close and water leaked every where in my trunk."
"OR";"I was surprised by the quality. The strap on the back especially. It really sets it apart from similarly priced hats on here. I will buy again!"
"OR";"This rebound liquid diet is phenomenal stuff. I fed this to my late ailing cat and it helped nourish him when he needed it the most. The reason I bought it in the first place was that it contained a thorough mixture of nutrients for when the cat or dog was at a critical stage of health and was safe "
"OR";"waking up to find your world has become a nightmare you don't recognize can be a drain on your soul but to find that your life had be taken away and misused in such a way is heart breaking to know the loss of a child and feel that pain in your heart for so long that when the truth is right in front "
"OR";"This story has more twist and turns. People always try to hid things from each other, and this always causes problems. Can they make it?"
"OR";"I am just learning to play lawn tennis over the past 9 months and would put myself at Level 1.  I bought this racquet in June and have found it lighter than my other racquets although it is larger.

Hitting less balls into the net now, on both the forehand and backhand. Also serving better."
"OR";"This hit the spot for my geography class.  We learned so much about current knowledge and new theories.  It made my students think."
"OR";"This movie did everything that fans of the Marvell series were hoping for.  It brought the heroes of the different movies together.  The interactions deepened our understanding of their characters.  It expanded the sense of the background Universe that all of these characters inhabit.  And it had re"
"OR";"These are not Dell official drives, but work just fine in our older out of warranty servers when we have the occasional failed drive that needs to be replaced."
"OR";"Some of the events are a little predictable or not elaborate on enough but over all I liked it and would recommend this book...especially as a trilogy. The ending was good too!"
"OR";"Great product.  My first one lasted over 10 years.  However,  This model is less expensive at Lowe's."
"OR";"I'm sure this is good ram. It's the Corsair website that said it would work on my older MB when it didn't."
"OR";"Got here within a few days of ordering, naturally the cats liked the box.  Easily assembled in about a half hour, all the parts were there, and precision of the holes and fixtures was impressive, went right together, no problems. Instructional pictures easy to follow.  I like it !!!  The cats like i"

"OR";"I didn't like this all to well. It just had a slow reaction whenever I made any kind of move with the mouse (and yes I did every thing on my part to insure the bluetooth and settings where on point). I only gave this 3stars because I did buy this as a used mouse, I guess with any product never buy u"
"OR";"Used for a project at an airport for indicator light and worked great.  Had enough room to fit a CFL inside too."
"OR";"Bought this for my wife who keeps taking my tapes.  It works well and having the fractional parts of an inch labeled is useful"
"OR";"Smells good and my indoor cats (both of them) love this treat.  They get excited when they see the pouch and come running."
"OR";"Love this movie.  We watch it every Christmas.  The Blu-ray really makes a sharp black and white picture"
"OR";"This is a well built and designed mailbox.  People will not be able to reach into the box to steal your mail like other similar looking boxes.  The mounting plate makes it easy to secure the mailbox to it's base without having to hold the whole box in place.  Highly recommended."
"OR";"Came quickly and its has no arch in the shoe so it perfect for me. got 13 EE a little narrow but over all awesome I wear them all day with no pain. also I have had these shoes for 6 months now wearing them as a my everything shoe work, fishing, hiking shopping with the wife and they are still holdin"
"OR";"This was a gift so although I purchased it awhile ago we just opened it.  There was no repair kit or stuff bag to store it in all I hot was the mattress"
"OR";"I put this on at a party last week and it really got it going.  The spinach dip disappeared in about twenty minutes.  We ran out of ginger ale before 8pm.  And I can't find the universal remote.  Thank you, Peter Cetera, for making me lose the universal remote."
"OR";"It doesn't seem to receive as well as a ground plane antenna but the SWRs are fine and it has held up in a few very nasty wind storms."
"OR";"Standard size? Are you kidding? This was HUGE!!!!! It fell right off my thumb. The sides didn't even touch it. It's not standard size."
"OR";"This is definitely a winner. Action packed from start to finish. You will not be disappointed. Even with all the action, Daniel Adams has fun with his characters."
"OR";"This card works great and installs easily.  I am a little disappointed in the lack of software to support its functionality.

  I bought this card to be used in a Ubuntu server where I run Plex to serve my house TVs.  Installation was simple and Ubuntu/Plex worked right away without even having to i"
"OR";"Dimitri's story is heartbreaking and beautiful. He has become my no. 1 man in the series. In my opinion best book of the series."
"OR";"I followed the washing instructions exactly, these sheets made a million fuzzy balls that get all over the bedroom. So, I thought to wash them again and hopefully be rid of the fuzz balls - nope, didn't help. Trashed em and went to Costco, bought a set I am delighted with."
"OR";"Love the book and the characters. It was very interesting. I would recommend this to anyone with an opened mine. Hope to that there is more to come"
"OR";"Rugged and easy to mount. This bottle opener will get you into a crisp brew that much quicker. It will also save you a trip to the dentist for chipped teeth after trying to impress the ladies. I mounted mine to a wooden cooler I made and it hasn't disappointed yet!"
"OR";"I purchased a set of these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them!  They stay cold for an amazing amount of time, and as advertised, don't dilute whatever you put them in.  We use them not only for my husband's cocktails, but also soup and tea for me and the kids and they haven't picked up a"
"OR";"We are studying Mr. Wiman's poems in our book club.  Their descriptive and challenging images prompt lots of good discussion."
"OR";"This book is entertainment to the family :) Cathy Wilson is a really talented writer and 'Your Feelings Matter to Sam the Sloth' is a testiment to this!"
"OR";"It works fine. I had a little trouble getting the lengths of the braid right, so I went to YouTube and found a video."
"OR";"Great tap shoe but the regular was too narrow and hurt my daughter's toes. Ordered her wide and they were much better!"
"OR";"This was very interesting, balanced and provided a lot of ""What If"" scenarios. I think Ray is too optimistic and is on the utopian side of the fence which would be great in a perfect world. I liked the other religious, philosophical and distopian views which really rounded out this show and gave you"
"OR";"Works great. Easy to install and set up. Good WIFI receiver. No trouble with ""buffering"" or signal receiving."

"OR";"A very sweet story of falling in love like the fairy tales make it out to be. Why can't we all find a love like that!"
"OR";"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy mate"
"OR";"Total crap, cups are all scratched up and lid seal fell apart in 6 months. Glass is always better!"
"OR";"She was one badass woman but argued about killing the guard. Come on!!! She was supposed to take over the company? Poor storytelling IMO!"
"OR";"Great story. I really like this couple. I am hoping that they will figure prominently in future books in this series."
"OR";"Has about every security screw, driver bit you might need. Flimsy box, and the rack does not hold the bits very tight. The longer bits are great for getting into tight spaces. You may not use these often, but these bits are hard to find at a big box store."
"OR";"I really loved and enjoyed this great story.  It was great.
Thank you so very much for writing this very enjoyable story."
"OR";"I purchased this travel Crossbody bag for my vacation this summer to Europe. So far, I like that it holds a lot and my iPad fits nicely in the front pocket.

"OR";"Very good book. excellent and easy reading. I would recommend this book to everyone both young and old."

"OR";"I needed a long 8mm allen wrench to get to the transmission fill plug on my '11 Mustang 5. 0."
"OR";"Really cute book. Wish it would have a little more to the ending, maybe take it through the wedding and the sister's reaction."
"OR";"Any praise for Gaiman's The Graveyard Book seems anticlimactic after its being awarded the prestigious Newberry Award, but I couldn't read this book without saying a few words about it on the offhand chance that one or more of my readers may have been hiding under a rock for the past few months. I p"
"OR";"I enjoyed the book but it was too short to get your teeth into it. I liked that he finally got his mother what she deserved, should have done it earlier."
"OR";"This was excellent storyline. Tear Jerking, and some high emotions  you will get from read about  our two MC characters, you actually  can help fell in love with them. Full of great action  and suspense. I one many questions  then answears, but it didn't  take away from the main  storyline."
"OR";"The nonstick part works fine. But the bottom of the pan is not flat and therefore does not sit evenly on my ceramic top stove."
"OR";"This unit was good for a bit.  The overall construction needs reworked as after only two weeks the stand snapped off, broke, not to be repaired or refitted.  The shell itself is of nice material to absorb impact during a fall.  Ok for the price but needs to be re-engineered to put a better quality s"
"OR";"We bought this for our 15 month old niece for Christmas, and per her mom, she's loving it!  When we saw it at the store, it was really cute in design.  The sounds were not too annoying, and it really seemed to do a lot of different functions.  Kudos to LeapFrog for another cute and educational toy!"
"OR";"No headache. Works following simple instructions. Bought 2. One for a tv and the other for a raspberry pi. Works."
"OR";"Love the look of the shoe, and had high hopes that they would work for me, but I need a wide toe area and a narrower heel.  These were much to wide overall.  If I could wear a normal width in the toe area, I would have kept them.  Unfortunately I had to return this pair of shoes."
"OR";"Initially I was going to get the burgundy color one but they didn't have my size. I am glad I got the blue instead. As it was a nice purchase. It doesn't look like the picture provided by the seller. Nor does it look like something I included in my picture in this review. However its just a nice sky"
"OR";"Absurd plot loaded with unbelievable coincidences but numerous humorous moments. Hard to know if the director was trying to make a crime drama or a comic  movie about criminals involving a bundle of stock characters. When will they ever learn about the stupidity of the sideways-held handgun?"
"OR";"Nephew is a big Kirby fan and loved this.  This plush has held up well as my nephew is only 7 years old."
"OR";"This product works just as described! Will fold your shirt just like you see in the department stores. Super easy and doesn't take any more time than folding without it. Allows a tighter fold so you can store more in one space. I put off buying this and wish I had bought it a lot sooner."
"OR";"I have to agree with the above posters. When I saw the price for these I cringed but my hearing is more important than 50 bucks so I ordered these and slapped them on. Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why"
"OR";"So cozy! My daughter brought this to college to go back and forth to the dorm shower. It is generously sized and she appreciates that for modesty."
"OR";"I chose the book because I loved others books written by Howatch, but this one unfortunately disapointed me a lot."

"OR";"Can't wait to get the next one!!!!! Toke me about two days to read it and I couldn't stop! Amazing"
"OR";"A good little light that is easy to install and hook up. Should pass the need on a boat for front lighting needs."
"OR";"Bought this for my 0months old Gladiator halloween costume. Very adorable, the nose is kind of wonk, but it was probably just smushed from manufacturers."

I buy the same size as my first pair.. I love my first pair though"
"OR";"My new Canon 6D Mark II has a touch screen. Everyone always thinks that they will never scratch or damage it, and then we do. This isn't an absolute protection, but it sure will ward off 90% of the stupid things that a guy will usually do as he puts a big scratch on the glass."
"OR";"My son wanted Cats these were a great compromise. They look the part and are great quality but are much more affordable"
"OR";"This is a cute story perfect for the kids and  kids at heart like my wife and I. Totally recommend HT 1&2."
"OR";"It will probably work OK on powder burning rifles, but does not work on air rifles. Save your money on this model, and drop some more for the V3 version. Night and day difference between the two models. V3 more money, but more sensitive, has a SD card, more mounting options, on and on."
"OR";"This cable does not work as an Oculus HDMI headset extension cable.  The headset flickered.  I ended up having to use a different cable."
"OR";"Handy and powerful.  Only downside is that it turns on by accident when other items are in my pocket.  Otherwise a great product.  No batteries to buy."
"OR";"fantistic dirty comedy with no nudity i am going to watch it over and over it might be bearly clesn enough to let the kids watch."
"OR";"Low water pressure where it was difficult to rinse your hair. This made the world of a difference. Can actually was your hair and get the shampoo out."
"OR";"The book was a great ending to the whole story.  I wish I had read a spoiler alert because I was unprepared for certain events."
"OR";"really like this item would of loved some trouser to or apron but thats fine still great"
"OR";"Phenomenal read... well written... Shows that there are lessons for all to learn; even when you think you are the helper/teacher/caregiver, you can always learn something and come out the other side a better person.
Thought provoking book that likely aligns very tightly with the lives of many who de"

"OR";"Lightweight, well tailored. Nice Fabric. Have been a fan of the shorts for a few years. I immediately ordered another pair!"
"OR";"Really like it but mine started getting really loud after not even a month. I oil the blade and clean it properly but sometimes the switch to change sizes sticks and also the 10 will randomly start catching hair. Which really sucks because I use that more than any of the other lengths.."

"OR";"This classic monster movie spoof has all the cliches & bad dialog that I adored in the 1950s-60s science fiction horror movies."

"OR";"Having lost my mom to this disease, I found this movie truthfully illustrates the struggle.  And if you haven't already,  read the book!"
"OR";"I bought these to throw in my yoga bag and wipe my mat down with ease.  I find myself wiping my mat down before I start also due to the lovely lavender smell and again when I'm done.  They are easy to use and since the package is small it doesn't take up a lo of room in my bag."
"OR";"These shelves are great there's so many different things you can do with them  Great price too.  Shelves are hard to find these days"

"OR";"Dana Stabenow is one of the handful of authors who has created two great series

This latest addition to her Shugak mysteries lives up to the previous ones.  A delightful read full of her usually wild, wacky, and lovable characters and fast moving plot with surprises."
"OR";"It looks better on the website but its a very thin light product. It looked more thicker online. Better for skinny people."
"OR";"This series is true art. The detailed storyline, the familiar characters that continue to evolve and surprise, and the descriptive writing that doesn't use cursing, sexual situations, or unnecessary gore to keep the reader entertained prove Albrinck's master storytelling skills."

"OR";"Love these cards! A cute little addition to our ever-growing set of Munchkin cards :) Love the monsters - very clever!"

"OR";"Perfect for my arrow saw.  I can cut 24 arrows in one minute with perfect 90 degree cuts and no shredding."
"OR";"David Weber has crafted a great story line and I eagerly look forward to the next book. I have not read anything this exciting since ""The DUNE "" series and ""The Lord of the Ring"" and I read those every 3 years to remind myself what great writing is suppose to look like."
"OR";"Long time fan of pictionary. Played with wife and 5- and 7-year old kids and we all enjoy it a lot"

"OR";"My 75-85# dogs chew pretty tough. I got a few of these toys and NONE of them have any rips or holes in them. They are holding up well.

"OR";"We travel a lot and take our dog with us on most trips. This cover held up well on our wire crate and kept her protected from the elements.

"OR";"""Northanger Abbey"" is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man."
"OR";"My 4 months kitten looooves it. The 2 year old hasn't quite figured it out. The constant fountain noise can be annoying if you're sensitive to noise. It stopped bothering me after a week. I mean, it's water, so it's gonna make splash sound..."
"OR";"Two year granddaughter loves this toy! Well made. Melissa and Doug toys never disappoint."
"OR";"My pedigree kitty LOVES it !! of course this is what she has been raised on before I aquired her by the breeder. the ingredients I researched before I bought it is all top notch. natural."
"OR";"Great for drinking when on the move. Keep in mind that it does add some height to the bottle. It barely fits in one of my pouches now."
"OR";"Very pleased with product.  Was easy to put screen protector on and cleans off well (finger prints).  I would buy again."
"OR";"I was really surprised at how small these bulbs are. They are physically not the same size as a standard flood. But, they do put out an awesome amount of light."
"OR";"really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it"
"OR";"Was really looking forward to this steam mop what a disappointment.  Does not work on high steam.  The steam fresh attachment does not stay attached.  Would like to return but now that it is assembled the handle cannot be unattached.  Don't buy this product keep shopping for one that totally works."
"OR";"Read all except last one. It just became available. Bought it. Very good read. Vietnam from a different angle."
"OR";"They work, just don't like the way the head phones are connected, they whirl around too much for me, but they sound ok"
"OR";"This is my third one of these!  Comfortable and very warm. Only drawback is the exterior snags and rips easily. The first two lasted me only 1 season because I got them caught on fencing or other things around the farm. Ive sewed them up and use them for daily work and save this one for going out an"
"OR";"I really didn't like these to much. They are small but the rounded tips are a little to big for trimming around the eyes."
"OR";"this is a well done, clever movie. its got enough humor for mom and dad to enjoy as well as the kiddo's!"
"OR";"Comfortable and cute!  The wedge heel makes them easier to wear all day and the leather holds up great in the rain."
"OR";"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review. Here goes, this book was everything, I love how this author doesn't tell the same story with different names. I am not going to lie, there was a story line, that I didn't see coming, but made perfect sense. I can't wait for the next one!!!!!"
"OR";"I have Senn 598's which are open-back, and I bought the 439's fully expecting them to be inferior in all ways but bass (since they are closed back). However, even in the low frequencies these headphones were significantly inferior. They may shine on their own, but they just can't compete with 598's."
"OR";"This lantern is a great product for Hurricane preparedness.  Not only do you have the option of the amount of light that it puts out, by determining how many candles you light, but this can boil water, make coffee and even cook a meal on it.  Very versatile.  Buy more candles and you have a great ba"
"OR";"This is an excellent stuffed animal - Got for my grand daughters and it is almost too nice for them to play with - Great detail. I recommend."

"OR";"My four year old grandson just loves this puzzle.  He puts it together every time he comes to our house!"
"OR";"There's no point in heaping more laurels on Adams, he's a classic and is missed. This is the book that got him started and it holds up well. The absurd humor, the crazy situation, timeless classic. Makes a great companion to the similarly absurd ""sciency-fictiony"" book THE MYOSHI EFFECT."
"OR";"This is a great game for my 7 year old.  It's also very quick, you can play a few times in a 30 min span."
"OR";"Boy shags strainge woman in the woods, and starts to change into a female everytime he gets excited. meets beautiful girl who also turns into a boy, they take turns. Only good thing about this stupid movie is that the boys are cute. Don't waist your time."

"OR";"Just what I wanted big enough for one small pistol, holster and compact cleaning kit I like I like."

"OR";"Works great. Easy to set up. The red led is brighter than our landscape lighting. Cover it with electrical tape."
"OR";"Arrived as stated when ordered.  Works as expected.  Able to keep in place and able to turn over easily.  Will not know how effective until I have had it longer but expect it to be better than a regular small pillow that I was using.  Appears well made and like that the cover fits well and is remova"

"OR";"Love my silicone lids!!  They keep food hot and are indestructible!  Have given as gifts to several people and they all love them."
"OR";"This is a definite hit for Carolyn Brown.  Best book of the series of which all are amazing.  Recommend to everyone.  So loved Eeyore."
"OR";"My plecostomus devour these (API) algae wafers in no time flat. They apparently love the taste. I feed them these daily and occasionally give them some fresh zucchini. I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily. However, they do cloud the water a bit, but tha"

With these filters, the water is so clear. We change the filter once every few weeks."
"OR";"Caroline Andrews and Josh Summers were the match that I was looking for in this series. They had different reasons for needing a second shot. Love was not the only reason to need a second chance at something important. Their encountered began with the previous books of the series. Through their seco"

"OR";"This was a present for our grandson, who found it lots of fun.  Since I have not tried it myself, I don't know how it would hold up or how warm it is."
"OR";"I LOVE HER WORK.  HAVEN'T READ A BOOK YET THAT I DON'T LIKE.
I recommend everything she writes."
"OR";"Purchased these for my husband who usually wears XXL.  These were very long (below mid thigh) and the arm openings were huge (and he has big arms)."
"OR";"First one broke where the end-piece connects to the wire, but my cat loves these and for the price I'll keep buying."
"OR";"These are like treat size for a large dog. My dog doesn't even lay down with the, she just chomps them in a couple bites."
"OR";"Although according to the actual record, this was not actually written by Tom Clancy, it is outstanding and I couldn't put it down.  Brilliantly written."
"OR";"Pretty neat little things.  Going to put one in each vehicle for emergencies.  The strobe feature is great."
"OR";"The size is exactly what I need.  It serves the purpose, however, it has to be treated very gently, being careful not to break the plastic hinges or to have bottles flying around when pulling out the drawers.  Plastic bottles work better because they are not as heavy. The idea is good and would be b"
"OR";"I have found this bible to be very helpful in its translation of the King James version.  Simplifies the old English while keeping to the true content."
"OR";"These dental chews are great for keeping their breath fresh and their teeth clean.  And my furkids love them!  It's like candy to them."
"OR";"It doesn't come with the rings used for mounting, which was quite disappointing> They should advertise it.
It works well and it is quite accurate."
"OR";"As others have said, they are a bit tinny, however, for my relatively simple needs, they're fine. I got them to replace an old pair of speakers for my desktop. They're even adequate for music for non-serious listeners, but the bass, as has been said, almost disappears. I also wanted something relati"
"OR";"The top looks awfull unless you have big boobs. The bottoms run small. Couldnt even wear this."
"OR";"I bought this for my child during his second month of life and even then he enjoyed it. Older now, he still enjoys it. The high contrast colors grab his attention, the varying textures keep him interested, manipulating the rings challenges him, and the way it rattles amuses him. Money well spent."
"OR";"This shoes are a great value and the only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because in the picture you cannot the exact color of the leather."
"OR";"Wonderful and intriguing story line. It was different and not dull and lifeless. Makes you want to read the entire series."
"OR";"Incredibly informative! Aside from some initial confusion with RecylerViews an excellent way to start ones Android development experience!"
"OR";"Colors are off white & a pink red color. Returned it since it clashes with my real white & red kit hen."
"OR";"This very enjoyable story takes unusual directions from the start. Our heroine is a young woman of respectable background who has had her life ruined by a wealthy man. She has been banished to a convent. Meanwhile our hero is a man who went to America as a trader but took the losing side in the Civi"
"OR";"When you have a strong chewing dog, you can't expect a toy like this to last very long.  Like maybe 3 minutes max.  So it went for this toy.  I do better tying shreds of old clothing to the Teaser.  Forget squeakers for my dog--she will disable them within minutes."
"OR";"We are getting ready to travel internationally and this money belt seems to be just what I wanted.  It has enough space for credit cards and foreign money and can be worn safety away from pick pockets under my shirt.  I had it on all day around the house and forgot I had it on, it should work out gr"

"OR";"I scratched the first one. this is exactly like the original. high quality and easy to install. Thanks for carrying it."
"OR";"I use these for scale plastic models.  Most of them are useful, but about a quarter are probably more suited to be used on wood due their coarse grit."
"OR";"The first few chapters were very hard to get through, because they described a lot of  domination and brutality. It was hard to read how the Normans and Vikings treated these women and innocent servants. I'm not a big fan of rape in romance novels (although I seem to remember it being popular in the"
"OR";"It's a small piece and glows in the dark. Nice accent for your aquarium, just put it in and see how nice your tank looks."
"OR";"I purchased 2 of these. Both my Grand Daughters enjoyed arranging & rearranging the pieces. Ordering the Nativity set also."
"OR";"Poor design, handgun fits holster ok but holster mount offers no support on your belt, should have sent back."
"OR";"My daughter loves playing with this boat during tubby time! Cute, simple design. Will hurt if dropped on your toes."

The one gang called The Silver Daggers  reminded me of a gre"
"OR";"It does run VERY small. The medium fits, but I admit it looked like a Barbie belt when I first got it! Very stretchy."
"OR";"Both cats are eating it, Buy this most of time, Seems like it has what older cats, (15 & 9 yrs.) like."
"OR";"A nice pruning saw with very sharp teeth. Folding blade has a safety stop before fully closing to protect fingers."
"OR";"ok story line, recieved quickly from seller. better korean movies out their. would not purchase it again though"
"OR";"Like the idea of putting treat inside the toy, but for bigger dogs (Rott) she chewed right threw it."
"OR";"Every cat I have given these to have so far loved them. They are especially a huge hit with 8-10 week old kittens!"
"OR";"Bought this for a scout troop. Keeps contents cold and is very durable. It's also large enough to hold most of our food."
"OR";"A Person (s) asked me to by these (3) for her- them. One was very pleased!  WV is hilly , so no signal could be picked up . But it is a good product."
"OR";"I'm a size 14, and 5'4"" tall, broad shoulders, stocky, athletic build. The X-Large fits me perfectly. It isn't clingy at all and hangs nicely. It literally fits the same on me as it does on the model. It also washed well with no shrinkage. I'm planning on ordering more colors."
"OR";"Overall a little smaller than expected but perfect for a toddler and comes in a handy bag to pack everything back into."
"OR";"obviously it's cheap so it fits a little strange but fits none the less! perfect for the beach trip I bought it for :)"
"OR";"I enjoyed it very much. It was fast paced and exciting. I also liked how Riddle (pen name?) tied in the Spanish flu--with its mysterious cytokene storm. I have to admit I don't quite understand how the ""bell"" disease vector worked exactly.

Coincidentally? Stephen King's--The Stand--worked in an alm"
"OR";"I would wear this in a minute is it were a size 16.  Look fantastic on the American Girl doll..  Good purchase."
"OR";"Jim Knighthorse back again, in a much too brief appearance.  As witty and brilliant as ever and always on top of his game.  I also enjoyed seeing his 'friends' from previous adventures.  I agree, the original ending is the best.  I highly recommend this short story, you won't be disappointed!"
"OR";"Love Deborah Bladon ! I find myself always looking for something new from her to read. Her style of written is so easy to get into that it takes no effort to become immersed in the characters and storyline. I love how she keeps jumping off onto new characters that have been mentioned previously in o"
"OR";"Really nice ammo can and boxes. Very good way to keep reloads handy, organized and protected. Will be buying more of these!"
"OR";"This movie is pretty wacky, but a lot of fun.  It's definitely worth the Amazon rental price.  Adults only, please."
"OR";"Light reading but with high impact. A must for those who would like to have a different perspective in dealing with everyday chaos."
"OR";"Solid pump that just feels well made.  Well worth the price and looks like it will last a lifetime."
"OR";"Meyer has a tremendous future as a writer.  Comparisons to Cormac McCarthy are just a tad premature given that McCarthy's overall body of work is of Nobel quality (I wonder when they are going to get around to that!).  But, Meyer is well on his way to establishing a voice to be reckoned with now and"
"OR";"This author  gives you everything  in this story. This is the 2nd trilogy  i have  read from  her. I loved hearing and rooting for  Mark and Carrie."
"OR";"Was hoping these shoes would last a little longer based on the price, but they were garbage a couple of months after wearing them."
"OR";"This was a gift.
Someday this movie will be considered a classic for sure.
The quality of this movie is excellent, especially, in the widescreen edition."
"OR";"Major fan of Lehane .... However, this was the first book of his I didn't finish. I didn't make it halfway through before I gave up."
"OR";"I'm spending $22 on a chinese made medium sized microfiber towel because I'm about to start camping and be on the go and I want something that will dry quickly.  I could go to walmart and get a cotton blend towel for $3.00  It said to WASH the (blue) towel first as it 'could' bleed so I washed it in"
"OR";"LOVE this stuff!  I add it to both my big dogs food and they gobble it down just fine. Been using it for years to add to their diet's."
"OR";"Lid pops off if dropped. Not spill proof will leak wherever it lays. And worst part is while washing for first use the rim sliced 3 of my knuckles deep enough to bleed profusely. I can only imagine what it might do to my child's mouth if she don't have the lid."
"OR";"Nice build quality, good functionality.  Easy to program.  Don't use the wireless so cannot comment on that feature."
"OR";"This deck is immpressive in it's own way.  Great for flipping cards, bending, curling, and palming (if your a magician) but they don't fan as well as I'd like.  They also are very staticy at first and pick up a lot of dust and lint if left out or used on a surface that isn't perfectly clean."
"OR";"Slow start.  Decent story Line  like looking into a mirror and seeing the same scene, one after  the other.  Creepy.

 other after the other"
"OR";"I use these for my cat who likes to chew. They are the perfect size for a kitty. With a little salmon paste, my cat is in heaven."
"OR";"But the sticky stuff isn't quite sticky enough. Except when you want to pull off the adhesive after it falls off... then it won't come off."
"OR";"I love it its very protective and i love the color. it was hard to get on but after I did get it on i have not had any problems with it and love the look of it with my ipad."
"OR";"I put the on my CVA Wolf 50 cal. I was very impressed with the BDC reticle. I practiced with it for a day and then harvested my best buck the very next day at 150 yards. I couldn't have done it without this scope. Thanks Nikon!  This was an awesome experience that I will never forget."
"OR";"Good story but too many details and repetitive statements in trying to get the story told,  maybe less info on what is on the menu!  I like novels about attorneys as cases are interesting. Funny entertaining .  ILL CHECK OUT MORE FROM THIS WRITER, that's a pretty solid recommendation!"
"OR";"Flawless install and set up with my new SmartThings hub. Fast shipping, quality packaging and great price"
"OR";"great activity for 2-3 year olds!  fun for them and keeps them entertained.  they can help place stickers and tissue on themselves and feel like they are independent as well.  The glue stick that was included was not good; make sure you have your own glue stick or glue and/or tape on hand."
"OR";"Dependable flash drives, I had some PNY's crash for no reason so when dad got me my first 8 GB Lexar I was hooked."
"OR";"I bought this for a graduate school course. Varian makes jokes in his footnotes and his explanations are a bit unclear. I'm not impressed."
"OR";"Pretty good addition to the series, I just found myself missing Matt. Great to see all the scenes in the Philippines though."
"OR";"Promotional quality, but nice for the price.  Not an item you will use often, so why spend a fortune for the big name brands."
"OR";"It was as expected. Haha, the only problem was that I ordered the wrong size. It wasn't that bad though because I was able to cut it to size."
"OR";"These are really wonderful. They are perfect for strawberry hulling neatly and easily. I've owned a dozen.  Not because they wear out; they don't.  They just seem to wander away when I'm not looking . . . .
Fortunately, they're not expensive, and Amazon seems to alway have them in stock.

A must for"

"OR";"this holster is a great paddle holster. puts the gun in a good position and holds it snug. I would buy it again."
"OR";"Zebralight is making some really quality lights.  I got this for a gift because it uses a AA battery.  For the size, it's very impressive."
"OR";"This was a great book! The only frustrating thing is that this is supposed to be the first book of a series, but I cannot find the titles for the others!"
"OR";"Line is strong & does the job but it has a lot of memory. Nothing special but its as good as most cheaper mono line that i have used."
"OR";"there's nothing like this brand is just perfect. the most comfortable shoes. Great design. five stars for you my friend!"
"OR";"Good price, solid construction, and easy to install.  Everything that I needed for the drawers I had been building.  I'd buy them again!"

"OR";"Have used this product for years.  My cat loves the taste.  Best treat he ever had. We really love it."
"OR";"I won't say it was better than the original but it was an awesome remake that they updated perfectly. Almost exactly the same as the Schwarzenegger movie."
"OR";"Great grips! Feel good to the hand and are just tacky enough. Easy to install and they look good."
"OR";"The flat clippers in this collection is my favorite tool for this purpose. The other two are okay, but I prefer equivalents I've gotten elsewhere."
"OR";"Fascinating! An inside look at the Lindberg family, warts and all. This is not only based on historical fact; it is an amazing love story."
"OR";"This appears to be a nice lightweight hat. Unfortunately, it runs too small for a ""one size fits all"". Most of these hats will fit heads up to 60cm of circumference or so. I doubt this hat will fit people with heads over 58cm. If you have problems with ""one size fits all"" caps, this hat is definitel"
"OR";"Great looking and pretty but has a bad smell  to it.  I washed it all but something they put on it just stinks. Other than  the smell.  I like it a lot."

"OR";"This is the 4th tag I've purchased and I absolutely LOVE them!  These are sturdy and of a very high quality!  I use them on both my German Shepherd's and on my Belgian Malinois.

"OR";"love him, the dvd, the quality of the product, PLANNING TO GET MORE OF MARTIN LAWRENCE MOVIES HE IS A GOOD ACTOR."

Horrid build. You could easily pull the fingers right off.
Returned for refund."
"OR";"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. I'm blown away with the quality of this bag. It's real leather, and thick quality leather! My wife loves it btw.

"OR";"Practical joke? Since day one of using this thing, I keep imagining that the Candid Camera crew is hiding somewhere in my house. This morning, for instance...

They are soft bites yet they are larger and a little thicker than some of the other brands.  I'm haapy with the ingredients and they"

"OR";"absorbing story; well defined characters and the force of truth (it really happened) brought history to life."
"OR";"I use these in my closet to hang my clothes and jacket.  They work well and hold well.  The forever classic large metal hook fit and finish is excellent.  They look more expensive than they are.  The hook itself is a bit shallower than I would prefer, but they work well.  I did not want the more poi"
"OR";"Needed a new lightweight dressing gown for my husband for the summer months in Florida and this one fits the bill perfectly.  My husband is 6' 1"" and 180 lbs. and the Large/X-Large size fits him just right.  Length just above his knees.  Good choice even if I say so myself!"
"OR";"This hoodie feels great and the color is exactly what I was expecting. The length is a little short, but nothing worth a complaint."
"OR";"Exactly the product I use in PT to re-hab my ACL replacement.  It it great for all parts of the body. Love it."
"OR";"Works fantastic and best price! I was skeptical, but my 9 year old golden is no longer having issues with his arthritis."
"OR";"Highly rated by MaxPC, so I bought it, and works at stated speeds.  I have a 6 year old RAID of 4 120gb SATA2 SSD's that still works faster, but the single drive is less hassle to set up with this less issues, and TRIM works automatically."
"OR";"It is an interesting story..but with a little work on the details, it will turn into a better story.  Yes I will follow the series."
"OR";"These socks aren't as thick as you are led to believe. I really liked them until they started getting holes in them after 3 wears."
"OR";"Poor video quality and the sound was inaudible a lot of the time.  I realize these are extremely old shows put onto disc but the overall quality was extremely poor.  I gave them as a gift and was rather embarassed when I was told about how bad they were. Would definitely NOT recommend this item."
"OR";"To many characters with nicknames and posting, not enough action.  Reaching 31%, reading I just gave up, could not read any more"
"OR";"Well, this one was very short. To the point I was in no way ready for it to end. I just wanted it to keep going, to see what happened to Emily & Michael, because dayam is the reader left hanging at the end.

If this novella (or short, I guess) is a ploy to get readers to need to read on in the serie"
"OR";"Good overall, but my cats don't seem to like tuna, so a third of this is not well received by the kitty landlords"
"OR";"I used the bottom to store a 28lbs bag of litter, and the top for 4lbs of dry food with room to spare. The wheels were simple to install and rolls across the floor just fine. Works perfectly and I love that it comes with a scoop, which we use to add fresh litter."
"OR";"Stainless Plus Great price Plus an Insulated Carry Sleeve! Great Buy when you order the BBBYO as they Give you a $15 sleeve in the price that is very competitive with Other Brands of the Same bottle that don't send you and extra $15 item. BBBYO is the go to Stainless Bottle for me!"

"OR";"Bought for a gift - receiver reads everything of this writer & loves them.  Book shipped rapidly when ordered."
"OR";"Beautiful ring but I'm not sure that it is IP plated. Durability just isn't that high but is very nice for the price.  Normal IP plating is very strong, but this comes off with minimal wear.

"OR";"It's a good idea but bin is made in China and looks cheap so you'll be paying way too much for what you get."
"OR";"I got tired of carrying a heavy purse! This is small but has several pockets. Get compliments on it. If you only want to carry essentials and avoid trash buildup in your purse, this is the bag for you.  Even though this particular bag is plastic, it's well made, like all Rosetti products."
"OR";"Not many choices when looking for a holster for the Kimber Pepper Blaster.  It tends to slide down and ride on the top of your shoe, but I that's probably a characteristic of most ankle holsters.  The snap strap is reliable and holds the Pepper Blaster in place, even when running, which is important"
"OR";"This is a very good food.  Looking at the Dog Food Advisor website, it is ranked as a 5 star food.  The only problem I had was that it made my puppy a little gassy, but he is prone to tummy problems anyway,per my vet.  I am currently using the wellness core conned puppy food."
"OR";"I really liked the story. I was not fond of the ending. I would recommend it.  It's short sweet and enough to keep me interested."
"OR";"AWESOME !! I'm 6'2"", almost hits knees. Very sturdy,  thick. This will last me forever. Very nice quality."
"OR";"This product is truly amazing. I hadn't heard of this product but with a car as old as mine, I thought I was forced to listen to radio or burn my own CDs. When I found this on a deals website, I bought it immediately and never looked back. Worth the price, even if it isn't on sale."
"OR";"Picked a book I knew I couldn't put down to make the transition from old school to digital reading.  It worked."
"OR";"awesome i got it and was in love. i can now show them off to the haters out there at school who like the stupid rays! go red sox!"
"OR";"Our oldest cat of 10 years has been having some GI tract issues that were occasionally causing him to have bloody stool. Sprinkling this stuff on his food has really made a difference and has greatly reduced the frequency in which that happens. None of our cats bat an eye before chowing down when th"
"OR";"These are great quality boots.  They do run large.  My daugher will ware a 7 in sneakers but needed a 6 in these boots."
"OR";"With the soft sounds and colors, this toy is a superb companion for any toddler and introduce him/her to the subtleties of music. Our 15 months old liked this toy but it is a bit early for him to get engaged with it. It seems to be more suitable for an 18 months old as recommended by the manufacture"
"OR";"Captivating storyline with scenes painted so realistically they were vivid with believable life. Wonderful descriptions and insight into ancient times."
"OR";"And once more we enter the world of Cardcaptor Sakura! And this time we learn more about Sakura's mother, and that Sakura and Tomoyo are second cousins!
First up, the battle for the Sword card. This one was in the dub, so I doubt there's anything I can say you probably don't already know.
Next, anot"

"OR";"Loved this bra so much I ordered two more! It's comefortable, the right amount of lift, and does not show t shirt lines."
"OR";"These do not stick well, and they do not hold my hand held shower head without falling off the wall. I would not buy this again."
"OR";"They are affordable and easy to use. The quality is excellent for the price! I've used this product for ~1 year now, and no bag has ever teared on me while decorating sweets.
They fit well with all of the piping tips I have, including couplers. The seam on the side of the bag makes it easy to mark a"

"OR";"After my first night sleeping on a NeckBone pillow, I ordered another one so my husband could have his own, too. I could already feel improvement in my neck and shoulder problems after just one night's sleep. My only complaint is that I wish these came in more colors, or that extra covers were avail"
"OR";"Great magnetic socket set and really nice to keep them together in the holder. Great product."

"OR";"Pulled me right in could not put it down had to see what was happening next with Brielle, Chelle, Meachy. A Must Read."
"OR";"Very cheap and flimsy. Not so easy for a 4 and 6 year old to get setup sturdily. Sent it back."
"OR";"I'm very pleased with this set! Ours came with literally everything we needed. The only things we bought were the hamster and the ball for him to run in!"
"OR";"I received The Skeleton Garden from Netgalley, Alibi, and the Chatterbox program in exchange for an honest review.

The Skeleton Garden is the 4th book in a series about a gardener who seems to have bad things, i.e. bodies, turning up around her. And in this book there are actually a few. Pru, the m"

"OR";"Crossbow has good feel, and arrived 1 week early. bolts are crap! went from box to the trash, kept the tips. with the ssa 16"" carbon fiber bolts I do believe this will be a good one for turkey, hog, and deer. will update after one is taken."
"OR";"My 3 month old can't fit in this hat! It's super cute and soft, but for a tiny, newborn head!"
"OR";"I Loved this whole series...what a great story line that was told for all three books and more like these please."
"OR";"My 12-pound dog likes this one better than the one I had before.  I put this at the end of my bed.  It is tall enough and lightweight yet sturdy.  It does not slide around on floor, the steps are not slick, and it doesn't protrude too much into the room.  I've had this for a long time now and it's s"
"OR";"I enjoyed this book. I was glued to the book because I didn't know what was going to happen next. There is suspense through out the the  story.  Tara adjusted well to not having any memory of herself. I thought Marcus would have a chance to explain himself, but he didn't have to it all came out in t"
"OR";"Such a cute and sexy holiday read. Dec and Holls story was surprisingly filled with emotions for such a quick read."
"OR";"Great fit. I recommend spending a bit more to buy these high quality gloves, instead of burning through pair after pair of the cheaper gloves. I found that I kept wearing holes in the fingertips of the other gardening gloves, resulting in fingernails full of dirt. These have reinforced fingertips."
"OR";"David Baldacci, is amazing. Every, every book he writes is great. And I mean everyone.  My favorite writer."
"OR";"Great glove!  Large enough for very large male hands.  Quality stitching, soft leather and canvas."
"OR";"my grandson is only 2 months old, but all 8 grandkids got a stuffie for christmas, sure he will love it when he is older"
"OR";"These are actually smaller than the 35 lb set I have from another manufacturer, which kind of surprised me.
Nice finish and seem to be tough enough to hold up to heavy use.
At $1 a lb they aren't cheap, but having Amazon Prime with free shipping made it a no-brainer purchase."
"OR";"Darkly comic tale with a revised film noir quality about two gangsters hiding out In Bruge located in a gray area somewhere between black and white that provides the back drop for an honesty of gangsters knowing their gangsters American audiences can appreciate"
"OR";"I could not stand the hero or heroine.  He was a jerk and she was a weak victim I had no sympathy for.  I skimmed most of it hoping it would end quickly."
"OR";"NOT COPPER!!!!

This is a cheap stainless steel mug with copper plating on the outside. A TRUE Moscow Mule needs to be in a copper mug, not stainless. The picture and title are very deceiving. I returned mine when I got it. It also seemed much cheaper made than what is pictured."
"OR";"I have verdigo & can't get on the floor for yoga.  I do 1 or 2 of these sets before I go to work.  No special apps.  Just you and a chair.  I've had a stiff neck for months, with this dvd I felt improvement immediately.  I had back surgery a year ago and the stretches here are great.  No pain."
"OR";"My grandson and granddaughter loved them, they keep them on the butcher's shelves and use them on a table, they work well for staying at the other grandparents too, transport well and have all they need to do their artwork at their house.

"OR";"Works great on my ps4! I would strongly recommend this! Working great still months later."
"OR";"The only issue I have wih this product is that the ""leather"" covers does not resemble any leather I have worked with. I am concerned, since this comes from China that they be using dog skin, in which case, I would be extremely upset. China is not humane about collecting skins. They take them from do"
"OR";"My dog drinks from it every time he walks by. And it holds a good amount of water. I recommend it to everyone I meet"

"OR";"Looks like pictured but my daughter doesn't  like how much the puffy sleeves are sewed in.  She complains that they bother her."
"OR";"Had to add to the high reviews!  Yep, our pup loves it.  Did have an strong smell at first, otherwise 5 stars."
"OR";"This was a nice change from Grisham's legal thrillers. It was a fun read with relatable characters. Very enjoyable, a quick read."
"OR";"Nice quality cable and it works as expected.  There is no noticeable drop in communication speed or quality between a printer and a computer."
"OR";"I always look forward to the next installment of the Stephanie Plum novels. This one did not disappoint. I would recommend."
"OR";"Absolutely love Jeff Dunham. I have watched this DVD several times now, and it is still funny to me. He has an amazing talent."
"OR";"The essence of a good novel is its ability to whisk you away to a place where you would not normally go. Linda Collison does such a thing wonderfully in her debut novel, Star-Crossed. Patricia Kelley sets out in 1760 from her paupered but privileged place in English society to claim her dead father'"
"OR";"I never saw the movie as it never opened at a nearby neighborhood theater.  I bought the dvd as a result of my curiosity.  I thought it was well done with Anthony Hopkins playing the title role.  In parts it was slow moving, but the drama of making ""Psycho"" was
overall okay"
"OR";"Greatly diappointed. Post was cracked, no attachment provided for the upper mast, and the method for the ""no digging"" installation was beyond pathetic. After putting it all together and installing it, I could push it over easily. The area around the stake was solid and firm, but there was just no st"
"OR";"Got these for one of the bedrooms, but these are so lovely they can be used anywhere.  Fantastic quality and colors are vivid.  Highly recommended."
"OR";"Nice little book on a lady's adventures on the road. Stories were interesting and good tips as well."
"OR";"This tripod for the price is good. It is short but I knew that when I bought it and then I just bought 3 pieces of  half inch steel gas pipe, 7 feet in length for about $20 from Lowes and slide them over the original tripod legs and now I have a nice tall tripod. Works great."
"OR";"I love these for all my athletic needs.  I have done all types from OCR to 10k races.  They stay in place and perfect length"
"OR";"Bought this after we lost one in a car accident. Once I got it connected, it works great with both garage openers."
"OR";"Characters not developed,poor grammar and punctuation, and a waste of time and money. Should be given away and not put up for purchase until developed."
"OR";"Love the product, works great - not so happy with not getting my 2 free blades like it advertises."
"OR";"Excellent on size, function and design.  A big plus that it is able to read 4tb portable hard drive."
"OR";"Funny, serious, and sometimes sad. This book is a great look at the journey to womanhood of the Latina narrator, Esperanza."
"OR";"So far, I have picked this up and put it down four times. Each time I picked it up, I had forgotten what I was reading. Just got to 24 percent of the way through, and this jarring inconsistency did it for me.  Chris tells the Secretary she doesn't drink, but several pages later, she's having a beer."
"OR";"Good buy. Cute case. It fit my iPad Mini 4 with a case just barely, so I'm satisfied."
"OR";"A simple game, not really a lot too it. But cute art, quick play, and not a lot of thought needed so it's a keeper."
"OR";"Good characters and storyline..just was more romance than adventure. .could have dis a bit more with it.  But it once again kept me reading..Just not as exciting as the others.."
"OR";"This is a fantastic story that is well worth reading. The author does a great job of keeping you pulled into the story."
"OR";"really good.  not a size that fits a normal tissue box, so i took tissues out and put them in this box alone."
"OR";"Since we can never have enough umbrellas, I was pleased for the chance to try out the TravelZen umbrella in exchange for my review. {I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion.

"OR";"I recommended this book to my friends.  I really enjoyed the book.  I will be looking for more of this authors books in the Protectors Novels."
"OR";"Isn't it nice when some works out exactly the way it is supposed to?  I picked up a pair of Sony bookshelf speakers at a thrift shop months ago and decided it was time to mount them.  But I wanted a mounting that was simple, cheap, and effective, took a chance on these satellite speaker mounts and f"

"OR";"These curtains have been in my bedroom for over a month.
For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the mid"
"OR";"Smell is suuuuper strong.. But seems to be working well. Haven't seen a single flea since applying."
"OR";"Totally took care of our needs. We used it for a 55"". Pretty easy to assemble and gets the job done!"
"OR";"Looks to be well made; plan to use with a Slim Jim J Pole antenna and my Baofeng HT."
"OR";"Not very good. It sounds okay but not great choice of songs. Also it's made from photographs not film so not real footage."
"OR";"Very good set, fairly durable and relaible. We go through a lot of them but I own a demanufacturing company that puts all the tools through their paces."
"OR";"Excellent, you retain your mobility while carrying essential gear
in a light weight rig. The Multicam pattern is authentic, THX"
"OR";"It is a nice little coin purse, but  I know the stenciled lettering will just not last very long, so I'll use it at home."
"OR";"The 9 paths he investigates are called naturalist, sensate, traditionalist, ascetic, activist, caregiver, enthusiast, contemplative and intellectual. These match up well with the 9-10 mysteries discussed in ""Living with Mystery"" by Stacey Padrick. What a coincidence or is it rather better -- a seren"
"OR";"Was good for 2 months before the leather snapped. Customer service was really great and attentive to the issue when mentioned."
"OR";"May daughter wanted some holiday style lighting to decorate her dorm room at college.  But she didn't want that typical holiday light.  These look so cute in her dorm room.  She is thrilled with them.  Happy with the purchase.  And three months later they seem to be fine with no bulbs out."
"OR";"OEM parts for my toilet. As always, Kohler quality and fitment. Combine with flush valve and tank bolts and washer."

"OR";"First off, I bought the whole package, UltraHD Lighted Work Center, the UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool and the optional 3"" wheels for the bench.

UltraHD Lighted Work Center: Easy to put together and very sturdy, LED work light and adjustable leveling feet. GREAT BENCH. And this is what I ex"
"OR";"Pretty amazing stuff.  I have a brand new house yet it still gets chilly in the living room area and the film didn't seem to help at all but in reality it has to.  You touch the windows without it their ice cold and with it the film is warm.  So I really highly recommend this!"
"OR";"I bought two of these for my sons. The fit is great and I like its colors. They do not strain the eyes and their quality is great."
"OR";"We use these for litter box scooping (not dog pooping). Love the lavender scent. Very sturdy too. No ripping or tearing."
"OR";"I love these shoes.  I love fashionable shoes but after wearing high heels for the last 25 years and a couple of knee surgeries I can only wear about a 2 inch heel now.  It is  very difficult to find a nice trendy sandal with a 2 inch heel.  This shoe is comfortable too."
"OR";"Great product works excellent for my media player fast and smooth great quality service"
"OR";"I enjoyed this book. It kept my interest throughout.
He walks a personal tightrope between client confidentiality and 'what is right from wrong'"
"OR";"This one just keeps on pulling you in and has you wondering what now.  Employing a better proofreader would improve Ms. Edward's results."
"OR";"Thicker than I expected but still plenty thin enough for the job.  Seems decent quality for the price point."
"OR";"MY DOGS TORE IT APART IN AN AFTERNOON...NOT THE QUALITY IVE COME TO KNOW & EXPECT FROM KONG !!! WASTE OF MONEY"
"OR";"A book that raises your awareness to social and cultural issues in other parts of the world.  Powerful and extremely well written."
"OR";"They are not really bad but the leg length are longer than I normally get and the material just seems stiff and noisy when walking even after washing a couple times. They spend a lot of time hanging in my closet just to help remind me why I don't normally buy clothes online."
"OR";"My dog (100lb mastiff, injured cruciate) couldn't walk well in the brace. She swayed and almost fell. The brace was a tid bit too long but the strap over the hips was good idea to keep it from slipping. Going to exchange for a different size, I hope it works better."
"OR";"Awesome! So easy to get on and off and never snags hair! Color is true to the photo. Came very fast too! Thanks!"
"OR";"was suspensful and sad - the author did nice job of turning events and making you cringe- nice writing style"
"OR";"Please note that the USB ports have 2.1 amps current available between them. That means two 1 amp cell phones charging or one iPad or Tablet. But NOT a cell phone AND an iPad or tablet. And certainly not two tablets. For the price, it's a win."
"OR";"I really enjoyed Vincent and Danai's  book very much, it was well written and erotic. The chemistry and sex was hot and sensual. I was glad Vicent did not married Gemma, I really did not like her.  The plot was awesome, Vincent and Danai were good together.  I received this book for an Arc review."
"OR";"Quick shipping.  So far it does a great job.  Is does make some noise, as most of them do, but is quieter than most.  Easy to clean, empty and operate."
"OR";"This Funko figure is excellent! The one I received was painted very well, which I can't say about a lot of other Funko figures I own."

"OR";"My daughter loves Vans shoes and usually has no trouble with them.  These ones hurt her heals to the point of bleeding by the end of the day.  Since then,  she goes back and forth between these and old ones until her heal gets callused over, or the shoe stretches, whichever comes first.  Other than "

"OR";"My son loves these dinosaurs!!! The dinosaurs are the perfect size for little hands but big enough terrorize any action figure or plastic soldier that may happen upon them. The toys are solid and I see them lasting as long as my boy will play with them. I recommend this purchase for any dino-loving "
"OR";"I bought one for myself 2 or 3 years ago.  I liked so well, I bought one for my son last Christmas.  He likes them as well.  The 10 year old granddaughter is now learning to shoot using it.
If you ever need any parts or service, there customer service is excellent."
"OR";"Great sneaker , reminds me of years gone by. Only issue, minor, is that the color, charcoal has a slight green look."
"OR";"These are cute & all of mine had good seals.  The only issue I had was all the stickers on the bottom of them when I received them.  Pain to remove those, but I got it done."
"OR";"Very small, have to be at a specific angle to see the numbers. It's cute and for my son, but it's not super loud or annoying so that's nice."
"OR";"This thing is great and you can't beat the price. I'm in HVAC school and have used this quite a bit taking line set temps. It works great for $15.00. I'm sure at that price I will be replacing it one day, but that day is not today. Takes temps and does what it says it will do."
"OR";"I  thoroughly  enjoyed this book,  makes you stop and think about the "" the what ifs""  in this world when suddenly we must depend on ourselves for everything."
"OR";"ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES.  AFTER SEEING BRADLEY COOPER OFF BROADWAY I FIGURED THAT I NEEDED TO GET A NEW COPY."
"OR";"Rinsed cerakote in my 3oz paasche glass bottle easily and cleaning was a breeze on my h-set single action airbrush"
"OR";"Ok for the money. The screw to attach the top piece to the base was loose. Tightened andnit works fine"
"OR";"Scared everyone who's come across them (on their desks, on the floor, table...). You'd easily mistake them for real cockroaches"
"OR";"Looks like another fun one. Suspending disbelief but hey that's what escapism in reading is for."
"OR";"I enjoyed reading this book and I am not a child! I found it very interesting as I have a house 5miles from the ocean. I should say it was very educational also!"
"OR";"My 2 1/2 year old Son loves this tractor and it takes a beating. This one purchased is actually a backup. The tires have cracked off 2xs so far but superglue seems to fix it pretty good. He can't get enough of this toy, it has been the favorite for 9 months now."
"OR";"This isn't gel.  It's Pepper Spray + CS Gas + UV dye, which is not safe for use indoors the way gel is."
"OR";"Fast, very fast. Samsung quality at it's best. Installation was easy and the cloning from my old drive was quick and painless."
"OR";"This is a very cute short Christmas story. The only issue I had was the crazy fast ending. Otherwise, good book."
"OR";"the fit was stiff and uncomfortable. I also didn't expect the top of the boot to be so wide and gap. I ended up returning them."
"OR";"This is much better than the first one I ordered Its a really nice blzaer I would totally recommend it."
"OR";"is very complicated for install because my system water shower is different style , really I don't liked I hope you liked.."

"OR";"Due to sport injuries I must keep doing excersices recomended by doctors, this elastic bands are an excelent solution for my excersices."
"OR";"I don't like this stuff. It's not very easy to use and mold caves from it. Honestly, it's not worth the hassle. I won't be buying this again."
"OR";"Excelent reading about pirated and seamen, I really enjoyed it. Great character captain Silver and how he plays his role."
"OR";"For the price, it's OK. Can't complain about anything this cheap... If the price was different, wouldn't buy and wouldn't recommend."
"OR";"Works exactly like I expected. Well built. I only wish it had knobs on the mounts instead of allen screws."
"OR";"There is nothing to dislike about this almost magical classic.  Engaging characters dish out comeuppance, snide one-liners, and ultimately, redemption."
"OR";"The Story line was so unlike his Alex McKnight series of novel that I have thoroughly enjoyed. Yt it was a fascinating read."
"OR";"I love this bag. It fits my yoga mat and there is a pocket on the side for me to put my eye pillow and personal belongings."
"OR";"I have improved on my freestyle technique and power greatly thanks to this paddles. They fit perfectly well and look nice"

"OR";"It's always pleasant to find a book that is enjoyable from beginning to end - especially when you discover a new author at the same time!"
"OR";"Sadly not sewn well. One pair fell apart as I put them on. Size was fine just poor construction"
"OR";"I counted down the days till this book came out. So worth the wait! And of course, this wonderful author leaves me wanting more."
"OR";"not working at all !! maybe it need something or work with short cables only ( less than 1 meter I guess!! )

"OR";"I love this product but it is a bit touchy sometimes. Otherwise amazing. Works great with my mac's multi-gestures."
"OR";"These extra links fit my Herm Sprenger collar perfectly. I bought two packs, and I was glad I did.

"OR";"Have had this now for over a month and use it almost every day. Simple to program. Good quality units, each part of the controller can be changed out if damaged. Collars in lots of colors can be purchased as well.  I purchased an additional collar and the unit was simple to reprogram to accommodate "
"OR";"I thought it would be kind of cool to have and have tried it for a couple different things but it just doesn't give you desirable shots."
"OR";"Great resource for IT directors and HIPAA officers responsible of the security and regulations of the information technology components and policies and procedures."
"OR";"Quality-wise, it was fine. Bright, SO soft, and it seemed well-made... however, it was far too large for my son.  My son is a bit small for his age, so instead of being a little bit it was a lot big. Wound up giving it to a friend and it fit her son well enough that he'll have room to grow."
"OR";"This literally took ONCE to teach my dog to stop trying to get food off the counter.  He won't go near it now!"

"OR";"This holster works so much better than the standard kitty harness we tried previously.  Instead of a lot of rolling there's much more walking and exploring so our active Bengal Boy is enjoying his walks and so are his humans.  The S/M size is perfect for an average sized kitty."
"OR";"I have had it One year and the display stopped working and only way  to get the thing on is with the remote.

"OR";"Good fit and they do a good job.  I have been using them for awhile now and like them very much.  I was afraid they might interfere with hearing ordinary conversation on the range, but I can still hear others on the range OK, and they reduce the gun fire noise to a level that will protect your heari"
"OR";"Ugh... Check the hole of your door first.  Turned into a project, otherwise simple install (after you get done customizing a jig to cut bigger hole into door).  Pretty cool not to have to use a key though.  A little bulky though, especially on inside."

"OR";"Make sure 6 feet is enough for your needs depending on your desk/table/office features, I bought this lock because of my Mac's Kensington Security Slot but didn't pay much attention on the length.

If you have to go all the way around you desk/table to lock you computer, this is not the best option."

"OR";"This holster is outstanding!  I am really enjoying it. The only improvement might be a sweat guard of some kind on the back, but I really like it as it is."
"OR";"I feel like an idiot for living this long without a waffle maker. Oil that baby up before the first use then you are good to go for delicious breakfast. Next up to try is a mac and cheese waffle. Obviously this product is partially at fault for my newest weight gain."

"OR";"Just the right size at two cups to hold snacks. And the price drop made le pull the trigger."
"OR";"Purchased these to conceal wires for a wall mounted tv and it worked perfect! It even comes with a template you can trace right on your wall for fool proof instillation. Of course make sure you have a stud finder and drywall saw or other appropriate tools to get into the wall."
"OR";"This is the third book in the series.  The writing is so so and there are lots of errors.  I kept purchasing the books because I like the story."
"OR";"These were fine.  100 pieces sounded like a lot, but in reality there weren't very many. They are tiny little chips."

"OR";"Very impressed this seller ships to APO and without extra fees either! Thank you!!!  Came in a compact box with the mattress cover already on it. Didn't take long to take its shape. No nasty smell like our last topper. Very comfy. Highly recommend."

"OR";"Quite pricey but the quality of the sole is excellent! lasts long and it also comes with a lifetime warranty from sperry!"
"OR";"I am getting to hate them even though I have 3. As noted by others they can give a false open reading. This is not good since it is designed to trigger other functions in a system.

"OR";"I will admit is a bit flimsy but that is what some other reviews said. I needed something that I could easily mount on the wall in the room at my father's nursing home so he can hang his baseball caps.  This fits the bill.

"OR";"It's certainly not your every day chic flick despite what you might think from the cover.  Chauvinistic sure, but if you take it the way it's meant (i.e. comedy based on reality), you'll laugh throughout the movie.  And of course women will get the happy romantic ending."

"OR";"This is a high quality product but one problem that could make is a ONE STAR purchase. I am very pleased, well made, bright chrome with a great basket strainer. After I installed the sink with strainer stopper down would not hold water, A full sink would leak out in an hour. Problem easy to solve!  "

"OR";"These fit together well, the edges were good, I was able to stuff them for Easter and they stayed together throughout the hunt."
"OR";"This is a nice silicon mat, it helps minimize the damage my dog makes while eating or drinking. However, my puppy is a sloppy drinker and there is still plenty of water on the floor after he finishes drinking. The mat is easy to clean and holds up (so far) to my puppy's attempts to chew it up."

"OR";"As the view of this piano makes it seem as if it is for ""kids"" which led me to believe durable or even just a bit more than a traditional keyboard. I was dissappointed when my toddlers dropped on the carpet once and it will now not repeating a tone over and over constantly. They cannot play with it "
"OR";"Great little waterbottle! It has held well and is very durable for my six year old. Easy to open and drink. Does not spill when tipped over or if it does leak a little water it is very minimal. Looks great and is super easy to wash and take apart. Mouth peices are replaceable and that is awesome."
"OR";"It's one of those dvds where you don't feel too bad about plopping your kids in front of the tv. Educational and engrossing for the youngsters."
"OR";"very sturdy, magnetic closure works very well, even has a ball mark repair tool in the zipper pouch"
"OR";"I bought these for my two girls. These earrings were more like flat stickers not the puffy kind you sometimes see. I cut them for the Christmas advent calendar instead of candy this year. They didn't even stay on ears for 5 minutes before falling off. Girls were disappointed and so was I after I pai"
"OR";"This was a new author to me and I was blown away! Loved this book, the characters,the story,all of it was great! I couldn't put it down"

"OR";"Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Both my kids have one and now he can play with them. And he thinks his is even better since it lights up."
"OR";"I liked this product because I was looking for something different as a gift. Chain is durable and the colors of the tag and bright and bold."
"OR";"Sure you can beat the price. Sure it's no different than any other generic metal toe-clip. I continually purchase the MKS brand, though, because their sizes are more realistic to casual riders. Don't expect your Jordan's to fit in a pair of Mediums unless you're a size 9 or lower."
"OR";"Amazing Excellent Happy Costumer. Rubber cover for the keyboard that I didn't expect. It's what I was waiting for. Thanks a lot."

"OR";"This book was better than I had anticipated. Enjoyable light read for a weekend. I will have to see if shes written any more books."
"OR";"Oh these are pretty cute. More of a craft project than a wearable deal. Of course you can wear them but wanting to uber decorate them causes embellishments to be on both sides. It's okay, It's really more of a make stuff together craft than a useful hair accessory. Of course you can use them. Over a"
"OR";"I purchased this to brine pork loin for making Canadian bacon. A 2 - 3 pound roast fits nicely, plenty of room to insure the meat is submerged completely, the top fits tight enough that I can turn it upside down without it leaking (not recommended)."

"OR";"I bought this book on a recommendation and though I gave up a few days of my life over it (and the next 2 in the series), I'm glad I did!

"OR";"It definitely wasn't the worst thing that I've ordered on Amazon, but the quality was so-so  and the sizing was a bit small.  The material was stretchy but didn't really hold its shape.  IT just didn't look good on.  Reminded me of something I would buy at Forever 21 on the clearance rack."
"OR";"Buy several of these every Christmas for the nephews AND nieces.  So durable!
The grandkids EXPECT this gift every year."
"OR";"Our daughter's swim school has several pair of these goggles on hand to loan students during class, so I thought I'd get some for my daughter.  Oddly, both pair that I ordered leaked water immediately.  She tried adjusting them many different ways, but they would not hold the water out."

"OR";"So, I've never read any of Dimon's work, but the blurb had me SUPER interested to see what would happen. I have to say I was NOT let down in the slightest.

"OR";"I did enjoy this book. I really enjoyed the circle of second chance romance stories. It really brings home that it's never too late. I am not the biggest fan of stories told from multiple people's perspectives, but the author did a good job of it. I think Georgia and Tommy's story was my favorite."
"OR";"This book really hit home and won me over because you could just HEAR the pain in Streeps voice as you read the passages. I find it difficult to believe that Streep was able to get through this book without some tears. But that's what made it such a real, resonating read.

"OR";"This sprayer does what it should, but it's made from very slick coated plastic so hard to handle with soapy hands.  Plus the hose is molded plastic rather than a metal sheath so doesn't want to lose the kinks inflicted in packaging so far.  But for the money I would recommend it without hesitation."
"OR";"Helps organize clothes very well.  Zippers stick a bit because the material is so thin.  Webbing helps see what is where."
"OR";"PERFECT as an EDC light! Been looking for something that fits in the palm of my hand and is bright!
Worth every penny!"
"OR";"I read the review and decided to order. This is a realy nice screen - good quality - sturdy 4 panel.

"OR";"Nice pans, good deal, didn't realize the bottom were not smooth.  Gave to a friend with a gas stove."
"OR";"DEEP BLUE ALIBI by Paul Levine is a winner all around.  The mystery investigation and court scenes are intellectually stimulating and correct with a real ""got chya"" factor.  The humor between the characters is sophisticated and down right raunchy at times, but wonderful to come across as the book un"
"OR";"Came as described and fast shipping. My dog absolutely loves this toy and it has  lasted for a long time"
"OR";"It works with my 2008 Apple Mac Pro running Snow Leopard.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the back light only flashes for a second when connecting to the Mac.  It does not stay connected but does reconnect fairly quickly after a keystroke or two.  Perhaps this is to save power."
"OR";"This stayed inflated for over 2 weeks and was a total hit!!! Much larger than expected, got lots of compliments"
"OR";"My 8 year old daughter was excited to get this after seeing a commerical. The setup on the computer was easy. My daughter probably could have done it herself. The first disappointment was how it morphs the pictures. I tried using pictures I already had and then took new close up shots but none of th"

"OR";"Had issues with being outdoors and the unit not turning on.  Appears to have an issues with the battery compartment keeping water out when it rains.  I allowed the unit to dry out and it never came back on, even after several days of sunshine in an effort to see if it would charge.  Worked great up "

"OR";"Upon opening these had a very strong chemical smell. After washing the smell went away.

After showing I used the towel and it wasn't very soft, it was soft enough but it didn't seem as absorbent as my regular use towels. These will work as guest room or backup towels though."
"OR";"These earrings are exactly as I expected in size weight and color. I love dangling earrings but so often they are just too heavy.  Very pleased."

"OR";"This is one of the nicest ties I own. That sliver one looks amazing! I paired it with dress blue dress shirt and it looked outstanding. It's in between a skinny tie and regular tie. It's also pretty long. You way want to use the Windsor Knot when you tie this tie."

"OR";"These are the best quality puzzles with the most beautiful pictures.  My 7 year old daughter and I love doing them together."
"OR";"Great for indoor practice!  They're a firm foam with a glossy, realistic looking soft shell.  They feel somewhat like the stress balls that people have in their offices for squeezing stress away.  I haven't damaged anything in my home, even when I use my driver."
"OR";"I was looking forward to this dvd. However, was disappointed:

- The presentation could have been better.  The background & lighting is drab with a crinkly velvet curtain that distracts the eyes from following her movement. And in parts she seems too absorbed in following her movements in the mirror"
"OR";"These are great.
Simple design
Well made and reasonably priced.
I will definitely buy these again and I definitely recommend them."
"OR";"Spiritual. I would recommend this book for the spiritual journey it takes you through out the story. It is a feel good book."

"OR";"Bought to watch with my son. no issues mailed to me fast every part of this went well :) great"

"OR";"Love this sight! Very clear and simple to use! Combined it with the Vortex 3x magnifier, super win combination!"

"OR";"This product is well made but my slender and tall 9 year old found it to be too uncomfortable and refused to wear it.  We tried several other brands with the same issue until we found the Nutty Buddy System here on Amazon.  It may be more comfortable for children who aren't so slender but didn't wor"
"OR";"Disappointed in the deviation from the book.  Hey I get it.. you have all of these successful characters from ""LOTR""  still a cool movie."
"OR";"fits well, is soft like I had hoped it would be.  Great sweater to wear around the house or out and about."
"OR";"a delightful visionary work that features a lovable cast of characters that often prove surreal as well as very human. Among the family friendly films out there, this one presents plenty of visual treats and humor to hold adult attention. The soundtrack is pretty groovy, too."
"OR";"Love Julia Stiles - this movie brought it all the way through.  If you are a dancer, dance lover, dance enthusiast - this movie is for you!"
"OR";"Fun game! Something that I know I will pull out every once in a while to play with the kids and won't just sit at the bottom of the closet."

"OR";"My daughter got these for her 3rd birthday and plays with them all the time!  She has almost all of the Magiclip dolls and plays with them every day."
"OR";"This workout is broken up into four, 15 minute sections.  You need the breaks in between because some of the moves are intense, and will make you feel the burn. The more you do the workout during the week the easier it becomes. Mary Helen does a good job explaining each move. It's good to the do the"
"OR";"Neat idea but the fabric is too thick and the chest piece is much smaller than shown; it hardly covered anything."
"OR";"I am never without a bottle of Weldbond close at hand in my work shop. I use it to bond everything and I especially like it's flexibility and stability in hot weather. All in a glue that's non-toxic and water cleanup without any fumes or even that urea smell from Elmers."
"OR";"Nothing says 'Merica like these bad ass Classic American Patriot Flag Wayfarer sunglasses. These sunglasses are as amazing as the grand finale fireworks show. They're built strong like this amazing country I live in and will get plenty of attention."
"OR";"I got these for the folding closet doors and they are a bit too wide, but we used them without the crossbar and they work very well."
"OR";"And this was cheap. No reason to spend more money and waste of materials to throw away a blender base that still works."

"OR";"Only a little moisture shuts these down, and the earpieces need replacement immediately for comfort.  They do sound good and are loud.  The changeable chamber caps do make an incredible difference.  I would suggest Sony or Klipsch earpieces and dry ear canals.  For a workout these should be rated no"

"OR";"My son likes this but because it folds in half the tent style doesn't stay upright for long. Keeps collapsing."

"OR";"Really pretty but they fit too tight at the width of the foot mainly bc the laces don't adjust at the very base of the laces so if your foot is wide it's gonna be too uncomfortable . I had to send them back . I wear a 9 and my foot is moderately wide and it didn't fit comfortable"

"OR";"I picked this book up free on Amazon. It was well worth the price I paid LOL!

It was an okay book. It read quickly and was intriguing even if a little predictable. The writing was okay. There was decent character development. If you are looking for a quick, fast read, this could satisfy that need."

stop with the word requirements!"
"OR";"The classic.  I love swiftwicks and the 7 is the perfect height for my long legs.  I've thrown out all my normal socks and wear these exclusively. Compression is excellent for long days on your feet or in the saddle.  My original pair is over 4 years old and still ticking. Great buy."
"OR";"Well reasoned analyses of political problems accompanied by logical conclusions  and probable outcomes.  Thoughtful portraits of recent historical figures and their significance.  Moving personal stories. Great humor and wit. Tremendous honesty runs a course throughout the book."
"OR";"I lost one of the earrings the first time I wore them.  I seldom have an earring slip out of the lobe, but while shopping I reached up to check and make sure they were both still there and sure enough, one had fallen out somewhere.  The color was a deep, rich red crystal and they were beautiful earr"
"OR";"I love seeing great actors that you've seen over the years in a movie all together. Had a few funny parts."

"OR";"Bought this one as a replacement for the one my grandson wore out after about 4 years.  Excellent quality, they are amazing."
"OR";"We used it for a party.  After the party we put the sever in the refrigerator and used it a few days later for another party. I washed the unit by hand and washed the storage cups in the refrigerator. At first we kept the condiments cool with ice cubes and then used small ice packs."
"OR";"Haven't had to use it yet, hope I never do. By that I'm saying that I hope to never have my pet suffer an injury that would need me to try and stop a bleeding wound, however, if that should happen I feel confident that the Styptic Powder from Miracle Care will be a huge help."
"OR";"To thin and first time I sat down the string that was tied to chair ripped off. Cheap price still not worth it."
"OR";"This has worked well for me.  It does exactly what it's advertised to do and seems well-constructed.  I've had mine for well over a year now and it's still going strong.  Used exclusively for taking hot soups to the office for lunch - I've never used it for coffee but expect that it would perform ju"
"OR";"As advertised. Used this to smooth out the rough edge on the cut side of porcelain tiles. Used while spraying water."
"OR";"who would have thought this would be the hit toy at Xmas for my niece 5 and nephew 6 - the adults had fun with it too"
"OR";"This is a good steamer for travel. Very effective. Since travel size you have to fill the tank with water a few times which is not a hassle."
"OR";"Arrived Early. Fits great and functions well. Is a great replacement for the plastic original follower"
"OR";"My 5 year old and my 3 year old really enjoyed the DohVinci Deluxe Styler.  They played with it back and forth between them for around an hour. There was a little bit of fighting over who's turn it was so you know they liked using it.

"OR";"I grew up with the original, my daughters are growing up with this remake, and they love it. Dont go into this movie expecting it to be just like the original, its not. And thats ok. Judging this movie in its own, as a made-for-TV-movie its great. Good songs, cute child actors, predictable plot, exa"
"OR";"Fun retelling of fairy tales that have been reimagined and expanded. Loved the depth that Melanie Dickerson brought to the characters."
"OR";"Just what I needed in the RV.  Keeps tabs on battery, charges/runs anything USB that I have put on it and a 12volt socket to finish it off."
"OR";"Unusal behavior, this was a true story.  I never could understand what this fellow thought he was protecting.  I would not watch this again."
"OR";"These add just the right amount of bling and can be dressed up or down. Rich color gold. About the size of a quarter. Look more expensive than they are"
"OR";"Bonita Faye is so well drawn I feel I could have known her instantly on an Oklahoma street.  I will miss these people."
"OR";"7 yo twin girls , totally Barbie.. love them and the color changing options.  A hit, all I can say!"
"OR";"Really nice, solid worth every cent. Have given a few of these are presents and EVERYONE goes on and on about how nice they are. High quality and something you will be happy to own. They are about as big as a sliver dollar so you can put them in a clear coin holder if you like to sane wear and tear "
"OR";"These are pretty good. The only drawback is they build up moisture internally causing some issues. Still worth the money at $16"
"OR";"Good scope for the money! Put it on a Mosin 98/31.  Changes the gun balance which any long relief sight will do."
"OR";"I inherited a 6 gallon compressor and a couple of air houses from a family member.  I'm guessing they are about 10 year old.  All of the fittings were leaking air pretty badly to the point where the compressor was almost always running.  I replaced the fittings with these and couldn't be happier."
"OR";"This is cute, but its a little small for my 3 year old son.  But he does like to play on it.  Very easy to tip over."

"OR";"Would have been perfect but two tiles were damaged. Went to local hardware store to just replace the two and they were not compatible"
"OR";"Hangs too low for me, but I was able to unhook the straps and convert it in to a halter top. Not perfect, but gets the job done."
"OR";"I liked these knifes, but aren't as sharp as other ceramic knives I've seen (although I'm no expert by any mean)."
"OR";"It was difficult keeping up with the two law enforcement agencies and plots.  And the ending left the most important question unanswered."

"OR";"My overweight tom cat has lost 2 lbs of body fat and is doing well with this food. I recommend it highly."
"OR";"Great product but they run very small.  Bought 2 X-LARGE because of other reviews and puppy outgrew in a month."
"OR";"This hat looks like it was made for a child. It was way too small - I gave it to my 3year old granchild."
"OR";"While these are a little pricey, my cat asks for one everyday.  And they are good for her teeth, so well worth the purchase"
"OR";"I loved this series! There was a couple errors, but nothing so bad that is slowed me down. Can't wait to read more from this author."

Ultimately had to go with another solution but it was cheap and worked well for what it was.  Hardly any latency in preview modes on various capture software I tr"
"OR";"Fits well.  Just a plain black pump.  Not especially stylish but fits my need for a plain black pump."
"OR";"Had my doubts, but it totally did the trick.  Sound is clear as a whistle.  Took seconds to set up-without reading the instructions :)"
"OR";"Perfect for keeping the cold ground off while you sleep. The straps are an amazing addition. So convenient and simple to stow and pack."
"OR";"If you are buying Def Tech speakers, do yourself a favor and splurge on these brackets.  They make installating quick, easy, and secure."
"OR";"This is a fun look at what we thought the future was going to be.  The show was skipping over a few things from the Movie but is humorous to watch,"

"OR";"Ben and Jake are so adorable and sexy. I loved every minute of this book. I experienced every emotion while reading this story. It's so hot! I was so sorry when it ended. I need more.

Apparently great smell/flavor and they are low in fat and natural so the day care people are happy to have treats to share with the other dogs, even the ones that could afford to lose a few pounds.  Great price, I will continue to purch"
"OR";"Awesome movie with a hot woman who does a good job of playing the devil. We need more of these kind of films."
"OR";"This isn't a horror movie. It's a Gothic romance. I went into this movie with low expectations and ended up enjoying it for the most part. The plot isn't anything new and the story is predictable. I did wish they had fleshed out Thomas' character more. Without spoiling I didn't really get why he lov"
"OR";"Top class.
And still has 3/4 chapters to write of a great career.

Honest to the bone.brave brave professional."
"OR";"Wow! So cute! So comfortable! Perfect for my wide feet, they keep the pinky toe in! They are super cute and have a soft sole. Easy to walk in, doesnt even feel like you're wearing heels and I don't wear heels often at all. Would definitely buy again!"
"OR";"Camera is over rated and pictures are NOT amazing quality. It is fine as a back up camera, but I would be very disappointed if this were my primary camera."
"OR";"Smaller in real life than I would have thought. Glad I bought 2. Very soft and very well made."
"OR";"Really liked this camera except it was a little too small for my fingers to operate. I didn't have it more than a month or two when i loaned it to my grandson & he managed to lose it. Otherwise it took great pictures. I have now just purchased a  Powershot sx500.will be sure not to loan this one.wil"
"OR";"nice looking, but it doesnt look like stainless.  It works great tho, quiet and efficient."
"OR";"I have a love hate with these, They don't last as long as they used too. But i haven't found a better replacement yet."
"OR";"Nice golf club brush.  Reasonably durable (plastic).  Zip line works fine - just don't snag it on anything which is true with any item like this.  This one is as good as the ""major brand"" named ones - as I have had them both.  Clips onto golf bag and is easy to use."
"OR";"This book rating was selected due to the lengthy details required to explain every issue as it came to pass ."
"OR";"It is funny, yes and lots of the usual social wit. His use of words and ideas are wonderful and you marvel at his genius but the story is hard to find.  I'll never toss out a Pratchett's book but with this one I'd recommend making long, guiltless hops through sections when needed."
"OR";"Received the dress in mint condition.  Hang tag stated size 2x, but tag on dress read small.  When I say small, it would not fit a 10 year old.
Returned and asked for another.  It too was excessively small.  Nice dress, sorry it did not work out."
"OR";"This product is very cheaply made. I won't even wear the bottoms because they aren't made very well and the top fits extremely awkward, not because of my body type, but because it seems to have been thrown together to sell and ship quickly. I didn't expect a lot for the price but I expected a little"
"OR";"My cat loves greenies period, but we were having a bit of a hairball issue.  We tried the soft chews, but she just wouldn't eat them after trying them once.  She however loves the Greenies, and goes crazy when she sees the bag, I think she loves the crunch, and they are just the right size for her. "
"OR";"Excellent product for recovering scratched CD's. Combine it with The Skip DR cleaning kit and you will be good to go!"
"OR";"It's two packs of chalk! One is colored and the other is white! I'm sorry, not sure what else there is to say about chalk...."

"OR";"This is my 4th purchase, this exercise bra is supportive, it fits well, it's comfortable and it doesn't loose it's shape.  I highly recommend it.

"OR";"The polish in this form is so much easier to use than the firmer polish in the cans. I would recommend this polish to others."
"OR";"I received this ARC for an honest review.  Sometimes step-sibling books can very a little predictable and follow a strong similar story line.  This one was pushed up a notch and was varied in its outline with characters that showed their true colors along the way.  A good read and a pleasant change."
"OR";"The only issue I have with these socks is that they slip off a lot otherwise they're comfy and do the job if you're wearing boat shoes."
"OR";"This book keep my interest all the way though to the end.  Just Because you fall in love don't mean is it esasy"
"OR";"Lots of good info on the USA-USSR crypto war, quite a bit of cold-war politics mixed in for understanding some of the technical issues.  It is a long book and I found it was best to read and at appropriate points take a break with another book and then come back to resume this one."
"OR";"Seemed to be a tad under 1-1/4"" - I wound up sending it back right away because the fit was a little sloppy on my buckle."
"OR";"Excellent pack for the price.  Not as large as some, but it is for my teenage son for scouting and he rarely changes clothes on a campout anyway."
"OR";"This had a lot of good tips  and basic information on how to survive,
was a good little book that I enjoyed very much"
"OR";"Card works fine until my Mac Pro 8-core goes to sleep. After that it seems impossible to restore USB connectivity. Sonnet claims the issue is that Apple broke/changed the USB driver since Mac OS X 10.6.  Read their FAQ before purchasing!"
"OR";"Saw this when it came out in the mid 70s; before Don hit it big with Miami Vice.  My BFF and I went to see this movie every weekend for six weeks in a row; both because of the great and original story (Harlan Ellison) and the total hotness of Don.  Definitely a recommend for anyone into post-Apocoly"
"OR";"Basic shower head with a thumb off-switch. Great for use in RVs that have limited hot water tanks!"
"OR";"Although I may not agree with his conclusions. It has given me a deeper understanding of the man. Very interesting historic read, from his perspective."
"OR";"My daughter likes it, but it is literally the same story with a few embellishments as all the other Diana Prince/Princess Diana becomes Wonder Woman. Her mom doesn't want her to compete, she competes, she wins, she disguises herself, she saves mankind on the daily.

I strongly urge you not to take a chance on this power supply."
"OR";"Loot is fun with a crowd and quite easy to teach.  Some people always win and some people always lose.  It is the rash , impatient people who lose; wanting to get the game going.  Some players have trouble seeing the dark, deep colours of the card pirates."
"OR";"First saw this on Shawns YouTube channel & enjoyed it so I decided to search to see if it was available to purchase on DVD."
"OR";"I read dozens of books in 2016.  I am a huge fan of this book.  This was by far my favorite book of the year!"
"OR";"Bought this for my grandchildren.  They love Spider-man and were entertained with this movie. Would recommend this movie for summer entertainment."
"OR";"Bought this to supplement a Baby camera (DCS-825L) that no longer works in the dark, unfortunately the IR must be a different frequency because you can't even see it. I gave this 5 stars because I tested it on another camera I have and it lit up the area very well. I kept the product to future use."

"OR";"Gift for a belated baptism (3 year old). This is a perfect size for her and know she'll enjoy it."

"OR";"I love it, but it's huge! I didn't realize when I bought a large size that I was buying a truly large size! This can hold at least 6 or 7 FULL-SIZE shampoos, body wash, and such. I love this bag, but I will definitely be ordering the small and medium bags as well for local travel."
"OR";"these camera batteries are not from Canon but they hold a charge better and they also last longer than the original Canon batteries"
"OR";"My first Hakko was dead on arrival. When I turned it on, I got the error ""h-E"". After a lot of digging online, I found an obscure reference to that message pertaining to the failure of the heating element. It didn't seem very common, so I returned the iron and got a replacement. The replacement work"
"OR";"Outstanding classic. True story of a small group of courageous British explorers in 1912 that dared not to show weakness in face of great pain and suffering during their journey to and from the south pole. Good cinematography of a frozen wasteland. A ""horrible place"" as Scott said."
"OR";"Mmmm, best scent ever! Really fills the room and lasts a long time! Love it!"
"OR";"Within hours the netting ripped. The metal construction isn't great and it warped... I wouldn't recommend this product."
"OR";"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to th"
"OR";"This is a really good cutting board set. The only issue I have with it (and the reason for only 4 stars) is that there's a board missing for poultry. There's one for vegetables, fish and beef but not for poultry. There's a white board with some icon of soup or something...not sure what its supposed "
"OR";"Nice idea but flimsy in construction.  Given that you're trying to control your dog, the dog pulls or tries to get it off by pawing his face, the strap and plastic construction are way too flimsy.  I would rather pay more and have a quality product.  Nice concept, low quality."
"OR";"my kitties like this healthy cat food, but it took some time for them to adjust. my kitties prefer the texture to be a soft paste mixture. I feed it to them at their first morning meal when they are the hungriest. They would prefer dry but I don't like to feed them a 100% dry diet."
"OR";"I have used Speer Reloading Manuals for years.

Rock solid information for tried and tested loads.  It should be on your shelf."

"OR";"This is a large capacity microwave that we bought to replace one that was broken.  It works great, and was easy to set up and learn how to use.  My ONLY nit is that the display bezel hides the top of numbers when you are in front of the machine.  My wife says I'm nuts, but she's six inches shorter t"
"OR";"I purchased this product because my dishwasher used to always fill up with calcium deposits.  I was cleaning it every two months when the screens and holes in the wands would clog up.  I also had hard water stains on the faucets.

They are by far the most comfortable boots I have ever had, and I expect them to be even more comfortable when I break them in. The material and workmanship is very nice quality as well.  They h"
"OR";"Lightweight means the cats track it everywhere.  I have found litter all over the house.  The regular Clump & Seal litter is fantastic.  I will stick with it.
It does clump well, and odors aren't bad. If it wasn't for excessive tracking, I'd rate it higher and maybe keep using it."
"OR";"It keeps the water clean.
It keeps the water fresh.
It keeps the water oxygenated.
But it doesn't keep it cold."
"OR";"The bottoms held up for about 3 months of light use before needing super glue to hold the felt.  The bottom is hollow.
One is cracked, so they are not that durable... Even though my kids were using them it seems like they could be made slightly thicker less brittle plastic."
"OR";"Provides some real life glimpses at history in the making.
Recommended.
Now onto the next installment of the story and history."

"OR";"Had zero interest in the subject matter going in but loved the book, nonetheless. A great story, well-told."

"OR";"Good reading and outcome. The characters were engaging and I enjoyed the story. I would have liked to hear more about the characters."
"OR";"These are the best light hiking socks I have ever owned.  They have nice arch support and stay put on the foot without slipping.
With a thin silk liner sock as a base layer, these are perfect for a blister-free hike.  And they they stay dry and odor-free for many wearings."
"OR";"The product showed up as scheduled.  Boxed securely.  It charged up quickly but there has not been time to test its endurance to the name brand."

"OR";"I got these boxes for my partner to organize his game pieces. I like that you can customize the size of the compartments which is handy for larger and smaller game pieces. My only negative is that the compartment ""walls""sometimes slide up and down since they are not fixed into position, but this is "

"OR";"Here Feist continues his Riftwar romp with a new quest as lighthearted as his earlier works.  Though a bit more focused in plot than ""Magician,"" Feist follows the formulas used in the earlier books,  devoting most of his energy to action narrative in which the characters  remain caricatured stereoty"

"OR";"I own the 4x16 and the 4x12 models of this scope. They are clear and sturdy. I have one on an M&P 10 and I can put 10 shots touching at 100 yards. I would give these scopes a 10 star review if I could. Why pay 1200$ for a scope when these will do the same job and not lose zero."
"OR";"Love this base shirt. Wear it under stuff, and by itself. Doesn't shrink, always fits perfect and it's very soft."
"OR";"Good quality, great colors.  Very pleased with this puzzle.  It is just the right level of difficulty and fun together"
"OR";"Great job on this story line it was captivating from beginning to end. I wish for an encounter such as described in this book."
"OR";"I have a relatively small arm so these were no way near as tight as the picture portrayed...more for a muscular arm I'd say"
"OR";"What a sweet children's book.  I loved it.  Ronaldo is wanting to be a very best flyer.  I strive to be great at my career as well, so I can understand when it means so much to you.  This book is great for any age but especially great for kids.  This book sure made me laugh.  * I received this book "

"OR";"How much do I like this product. Let me put it this way. In no way did I feel like I was screwed with my purchase."
"OR";"Good product for the cost. Good sound quality, folds easily and can be used a variety of settings."
"OR";"smaller than they appear but it worked out for me because I'm using them for some additional lobe piercings and these just happened to work just fine."

"OR";"I bought one of these in large to try it out. The label was ""Urban Crews"". After washing it shrunk a little but was not a bad t-shirt for exercise (I like the extra length for stretching (no stomach shows)). I ordered another 2 shirts in XL Only ONE of the two were delivered. The label now said ""FWR"
"OR";"This started out in such a dark way, I thought I would hate it. In fact, this is a great story with a surprising twist."
"OR";"The great charcoal for a typical aquarium and value priced. However don't use it on low pH aquariums like Tetra's or Discus as if you have the pH adjusted down this will raise it. I soaked it for a week and rinse before and after the soak to help prevent the pH change but it happened anyway."
"OR";"works great, really sharp, I usually lay them down and can't find them when I need them, so I buy extras."
"OR";"Would be nice it rail were some how removeable. Have it mounted on my 20 gauge and it is kinda tricky to put spacers in place"
"OR";"No complaint.  Great product.  Pick a size smaller than your normal.  These gloves are supposed to fit tightly."
"OR";"I could not have been happier.  The pups were not annoyed at all by their collars.  I kept an eye on them so they were neither to loose or too tight.  And MADE IN THE USA!!!!!"
"OR";"This book is great! Can't wait for the next. It's full of action and adventure. Hope u like it."
"OR";"Loved these shows years ago and it sure is fun to watch them all over again!  Still thrilling and good entertainment."

"OR";"High output burner is what I was looking for, the Camp Chef has it. Construction is good quality, this is a sturdy unit, with a good set of legs.

"OR";"Bwa ha ha -- the master of the midnight movie is back, after far too long an absence from the scene, with what one might actually accept as the ultimate ""grrl power"" flick.

"OR";"I was completely captured by the story, I learned so much about the history of the Amazon basin and I thoroughly recommend this book."

"OR";"Takes great shots for a great price.... got this as a gift for my brother-in-law and his shots look professional."
"OR";"Great for keep out the sun and glare and anything else that flies your way. Great value for all you get."

"OR";"Could not put it down neither will you. Loved it. Human funny and very easy to read. Highly recommend this book."

"OR";"This story focuses mainly on the relationship between Ben and Smoof. Both characters are focused on their own miserable lives, just trying to get through to, hopefully, a better place.

"OR";"This series is nothing I could ever expect! And I love every minute of it! I can't predict what is going to happen next and am left aghast at what just happened! Cassia Leo is one of my favorite authors and unmasked kept me loving her, even though this isn't like any of her others!"
"OR";"It was just okay. Nothing notable, mind-blowing, or earth-shattering. You get what you pay for with some of these cheaper novels, and it shows in the editing and execution."

"OR";"Pumps up incredibly quickly, and holds air well. It's about as comfortable as you expect for an air mattress, though the added height makes it much easier to use for adults. Having the pump built in makes it easy to add a little bit of air when you feel like you need it."
"OR";"Fit perfect, rugged, way to go for work wear, last longer great bargain"
"OR";"Great little product. Easy to use and no fuss. Furniture stays in place on tiled floors now!"

legend.  A modern, cautionary fairy tale.  Share it with your kids and friends."
"OR";"My only complaint is that the case it comes in is pretty simple plastic, so the pieces always fall out when you try to open/shut it. I'll be switching to a cloth bag. That said, it has a little bit of everything you need and I've been using it fairly heavily for 4 months now without anything breakin"
"OR";"The head is VERY wobbly. It feels like it could fall off at any moment. The strap broke within a day of play. It's cute, but it's not very durable, and the battery compartment keeps coming out of the velcro. I read reviews about the sound not working, but ours is fine. It plays a galloping sound, bu"

"OR";"The product is very good, but just as other comment the case a bit bigger than 13inch MAC Book Pro, can live with it."
"OR";"This product was great while it lasted. It was comfortable and great for running or walking with your pet, however, the clasp stopped holding after about 60 uses, which was only about  2 months.  I will buying it again in the future.  I'd also like to mention that the dog almost never pulls, so that"
"OR";"Ok, but not the quality of orbeez. They fall apart easily and do not hold up. After 48 hrs in a bin they started to smell"
"OR";"This is great for heat gun (SMA) applications.  The RMA flux is great for unsoldering the old parts and getting a clean pad;  RMA flux is mildly reactive which increases the wettability of metals .  Most SMA jobs are usually small so this is a lot of product for type of application."
"OR";"Great flip flop!  Ive had 4 pair and talked my wife into trying them this year and she loves them"
"OR";"Reading hunt for ""Snow White's mirror"" should have made me realize it's a movie for teenagers, and not a good one"
"OR";"It was hard to understand at first, but it got so good I couldn't put it down.  I saw it advertised in a magazine for a book club and went home and downloaded it.  I am glad I did.

"OR";"Nothing special to say about this, good or bad. It's cute, it works and it was cheap. I like that it is more structured than the silicone cases for phones yet it still fits around the product with ease. The case looks exactly as it appears here - no variations. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the pu"
"OR";"I was puzzled to see why this only has four stars, since mine is beautiful and works great. I did have to unscrew it when I first got it because the battery had come loose and was rolling around in the lamp, but I simply stuck it back into place and the lamp works fine. The colors are vibrant and re"
"OR";"I read some negative remarks on the pack but thought it was a good choice considering it had over 200 positive remarks.  For $48.00 I couldn't have found a better bag.  It has plenty of room  and the quality seems to be pretty tough.  It's not a 250.00 tamrac  but for the money I would say
it's a be"
"OR";"Just purchased this cat tree a week ago. It arrived quickly and was better than I imagined. The cat houses were large enough for my adult cats. I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my "

"OR";"Easy to replace; provides tasteless drinking water.  I freaking love this thing, and I use it every day

The previous filter was a tad bit resistant to being removed, so I took the unit off the faucet.  Then, i was able to put all my effort into it, and it gave way without much convincing."
"OR";"Dani O'Malley is just a young girl...but what a strong symbol for any young woman to look up to.  She is strong, independent and fights evil with no fear for herself.

The people that design these squares did their homework and built a GOOD tool!!!"
"OR";"This is my alternative to a chest rig and it works with shotgun shell cards as well as AR magazines. Internally it can hold boxed ammo, pistol mag pouches and works as a dump pouch. There's a loop for a belt to complement the shoulder strap. Get a couple."
"OR";"A must read book as it is a book by Aldo Leopold if you appreciate land and environmental habitat development."
"OR";"I needed a larger tea kettle and liked the looks of this one. I was changing for another reason also, that the handle became very hot when it was used so I was hoping for a handle that remained cooler. However, this is not the case, but I still like its looks and just use a potholder when boiling wa"

"OR";"I usually wear a size small, but I have bigger thighs and a butt for being 5'7"" and 125lbs.  After reading other reviews I thought it would be best to order a size up and I was right.  The M/L fit perfectly and I usually wear a size 4-5.  Otherwise they are good quality and super soft!"

"OR";"It's a Casio, so I know it will last.  Just a little disappointed in the weight. I like heavier watches, and this is pretty lightweight."
"OR";"I loved the story of Sam and Chloe (or Same and Chloe if one of the typos wasn't a typo). It was a story of a long lasting love that just needed the right timing.

I can figure out the cost myself.  But it won't tell me what the wattage consumption is.  Need to plug it in for a kilowatt hour or so.  And how do I translate that back to wattage?
Way too complicated, and misses what"
"OR";"I love these things, I hope they never go cheap on these like so many other items do. Always a clean cut, available in many sizes, clean up well and hang in there.  You want a  machine grade cut in aluminum, steel, plastic, .....wood... start here..... with the Champion cutters."

"OR";"Works with a .308 rifle.  It hasn't broken after 120 rounds, unlike my NC Star laser.  It is very bright."
"OR";"Short, concise, to the point -- PERFECT. I've been a Basecamp user for a long time (the author is the creator of Basecamp), so buying the book was a win, especially when I saw it on Mark Cuban's suggested reading list.

"OR";"Great tubeless valves.  Had one valve core bend on me out in the woods, but I can't say that was the fault of the valves and not the mini pump.  I do wish they were keyed somehow to prevent rotation on the inside of the rim.  Other valves have ""V"" shaped grommets.  Not a big deal though."

"OR";"Disapointed ! A portion of the stand appeared to have scuff marks. Plastic not sturdy enough, very fragile thin plastic!!"
"OR";"Excellent addition to the series. If you're interested in a modern day setting with wizards, magic, and monsters, I strongly suggest that you pick up book #1, Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1). You will quickly end up back to this book, and the characters will be very well developed."
"OR";"Use it to heat the portion of my Thunderjet boat under canvas. Heated the cabin very well in 20 degree temps!  Grill that protects the unit get very hot!  Purchased the 1 gallon steel cylinder and 10 foot hose along with it to extend usage."

It comes with extra padding to personalize the fit, plus a dial in the back to adjust size.  It's just what she wan"
"OR";"I agree with others, that the plot had real potential, but didn't take advantage of it. It was kind of ""lets stick with the previous storylines that did well"". Predictable is the word I'm looking for.

Still, I like Diane Keaton and Michael Douglas, although they didn't meld well in this one."
"OR";"This is a lightweight pot that heats up and cools down very quickly.  It is scrape proof and minimally non-stick.  For the price, it is a good pot."

"OR";"The book, Murder of the Mind by Ndea B, focuses main character Alexandria, who is grieving the death of her grandfather and experiencing visions of him instructing her to commit murder.

I shared my copy with 2 guys at work, one whose dad fought on Iwo Jima too - they both loved the book too."
"OR";"Good product! Pretty accurate and if definitely helped me keep my check in bag under to weight limit!!"
"OR";"Funko POP figures have become my latest addiction!  Robocop is a must since I'm a man of the 80's."
"OR";"Great story, not just sex -although the S.E.X. was incredibly hot... This series has just gotten better and better"
"OR";"This is a great product. No more fears of loosing food to bears. No assaults yet but expect it to hold up nicely."
"OR";"Just a nice cozy mystery. Nothing earthshattering, but interesting characters, well developed, with habits and flaws. The mystery kept to the end. A good book to curl up on the couch with.  I'm looking forward to starting another Dekker Cozy Mystery that I picked up earlier today."
"OR";"The budget alternative to intel i7-4770. It runs cool, crunches 1080p 60fps rendering and lets me play gw2 with little to no lag. All for the same price as an i5. Don't let the xeon name fool you, this server processor can easily handle itself in the consumer environment."
"OR";"These are great cloths.  A little larger than I prefer, but good quality and thickness.  I would recommend them."
"OR";"My ferret loves the tunnel.  It is so cool that it is transparent and we can see her run, play, and even turn around."
"OR";"The color matches my real 18k gold jewelry. They're so pretty in person, a great size, just shy of half an inch and a substantial weight. They sit beautifully on my earlobe and are very comfortable. I love them and highly recommend them to anyone wanting a classic everyday pair of earrings."
"OR";"I really, really liked this book although there were some grammatical errors. I have read it over and over as well as the volume that follows it."
"OR";"simple, effective. bought it for my table for nights when company comes over. its great. and holds a lot of packets"
"OR";"cute gag gift i don't smoke but husband thought it was real and got a good laugh"
"OR";"my grandson is a big yugioh fan and this made him so happy! He is six and is teaching me how to battle the monsters against each other. Things that stretch his imagination and give him fantasy play are all right by me! It gives us something extra to fill our time together when he is visiting! Great "
"OR";"I liked the same things as always--great characters, lots of theorizing, solid plot and a backstory to boot!

It is a single read or a series read...nothing not to like, except there is always a bit of sex, relational issues, and lots of bodies. Alex, always obsessive, always debonair...great read."
"OR";"The first third to a half of the movie was slow, repetitive (part of the story line but it was basically boring), and not engaging, but I kept watching it  based on the 4.5 stars online review.  The last third was better and it had a decent ending. But I would not watch it again as it was just to bo"
"OR";"Very flat but cute and works for a narrow-ish foot. The straps fit well against the foot without gaps."
"OR";"Non-binding, not to tight around the ankles or legs.  This is very important, due to edema (water) held in feet and legs."
"OR";"Well constructed and fits perfectly. I am an 8.5 so I bought size 9. Very comfortable and can be worn all day."
"OR";"Only had them a week or so, but so far so good.  They fit well, and with me being  cabinet maker, customers love the wooden arms."
"OR";"For the price it's great! I took off one star for the cardboard backing. I don't think this is best for a shower."
"OR";"It broke the first time I got it, then it broke again never buy this product. It is so expensive for a piece of garbage."
"OR";"These pads are a great value. When I first installed them I almost did an endo going down my driveway not expecting the front to almost instantly stop me. Better than the OEM pads that came with my bike. Way better than the worn down pads these replaced. Thinking of ordering a new set as a backup."
"OR";"Returned because the size medium was much bigger than others I've ordered.  My dog slipped right out of it."
"OR";"I am a big Magnum PI fan. I needed a few series to complete my collection. Amazon had them for a good price"
"OR";"Buy it for keeping in touch with my relatives inside large shopping centers when I am travelling, it works just fine!"
"OR";"This game is a great game for preschoolers. It is a twist on high ho cheerio, but my kids love the ""sneaky"" aspect of getting to ""steal"" acorns. The squirrel ""tweezer"" is also excellent practice for fine motor skills. It is a perfect first game. Our whole family enjoys it."
"OR";"What can I say. I love socks and I love the New Orleans Saints. The socks are definitely high quality."
"OR";"After reading book 1, you have to read the whole series?  Chris and Amy are wonderfully hot together."
"OR";"I absolutely loved this book. Lucky might of needed a dose of reality a little bit. But overall it was a good book the only downfall was the plot you didn't see where the book was going until it was basically over.... and it finished with two diffrent deliemas. But I loved the fact i wasn't able to "
"OR";"3 year old granddaughter wanted to be Pink Power Ranger this year for Halloween. She loves it."

"OR";"these are very cute and it does feel like you are walking on comfy cushions.  They fit a bit snug, but otherwise, love them"
"OR";"I have not finished it completely, lost interest toward the last.  I plan to finish shortly, and may improve the rating."
"OR";"Smells great!! Doesn't get up pee that well.. Didn't come with spray top for bottle.."
"OR";"I'm sorry, what are we teaching our kids?  That police corruption is the way to solve tough cases?  Sorry, no thanks."
"OR";"My dog loves the flavor. These are super handy for having to pill your dog 3x per day for a UTI"
"OR";"My son has this movie on dvd so of course I had to buy it on the Kindle. Boys and dinosaurs go hand in hand."
"OR";"This was not for me as this was a gift for someone else. But the person that I gave it to did not say anything bad about it so I will say it is a good buy."
"OR";"The sex was to much, at first it was ok but it's over much for me I like a gripping story which was here. I just like more details about the plot."
"OR";"I was skeptical at first, but it's a good little speaker for the price. I use mine out in my garage where I don't need Bose speakers while I'm doing wood working. As an added little bonus, it will shut itself off if you disconnect the Bluetooth for too long. I forget to turn it off on a regular basi"
"OR";"excelent!!! the best for the price!! is a perfect product for me I am photographer and basic dj. love this earth phones"
"OR";"Loved this pinata. It was perfect. Came on time and worked as suggested. Would definitely buy again."
"OR";"Not to be taken seriously.  This is a spoof and a lot of fun to watch.  I really enjoyed it in all it's cheesiness.  It ws just fun."
"OR";"I have to say, I got this book out of chance and have to put out there that I feel bad I hadn't known about this title before.

This story is basically a modern day Romeo and Juliet but that hype of Shakespeares' master work never wore the story down for me. Kaitlin slowly falls for the one person h"
"OR";"If your dog has skin problems this is the greatest healing shampoo ever. Yes, I would recommend this product ."
"OR";"Isn't 624ZZ supposed to be
inner dia: 4mm
outer dia: 12mm
thickness/width: 5mm

Somewhere down in the description it says 13 is outer dia.  Title does not match.  These need to be bought at precise matching in size.  Please fix the title/description appropriately."
"OR";"Good quality and grandson loved crawling through it. Folds up nicely so it doesn't take up a lot of space."
"OR";"I returned this dress because it was too tight. It was beautiful, just didn't have enough time to get the right size before my event."
"OR";"Ordered the same size of the same brand shirt that I already own, and this one is definitely bigger, but still nice a shirt."
"OR";"did not fit on my background stand so I have never gotten to use this. The inner tube is too small to fit on the stand."
"OR";"Adorable and fits great! My granddaughter is 15 mos and this was a good fit. However, GLITTER EVERYWHERE!! :)"
"OR";"I received all five books very quickly but my problem is with the books themselves, not the sellers. All five books have the smallest print I have ever seen in a book. Even with reading glasses they are very difficult to read. Just ordered a magnifier to see if that helps. I can't imagine why they w"
"OR";"Did not work, ultimately found its way to the garage. Pieces seem to be made cheaply and did not fit on any of my filters."
"OR";"The SensorWand 14mm has a straight shape that makes it difficult to secure a PecPad on it. Similar wands from other vendors have a waist. Put a tape over pecpad around the waist line and pecpad does not slide. But with this wand pec pad has a tendency to slide off and quickly gets loose."
"OR";"Water stained and hard to keep clean.  Need to wipe after each use. I would return it if I could."
"OR";"I have always loved Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs. They are cute and funny. I have seen the movie a few times."
"OR";"Very good product.  I keep it in my refrigerator - it's very cool and soothing to my old dog's gums.  helps with brushing."
"OR";"Not really impressed with this at this point.  I have tried 4 times to get the analyzer to connect to the app without success.  To be fair we have done this right before practice so we did not spend a lot of time on it.  I will work on it at home where we have more time to spend trying to set it up "
"OR";"Well not much to them really, I did check them with a micrometer, right on the money!
That said you can't beat the price!"
"OR";"I love this.  The salt and the pepper both stay nice and dry.  It is easy to move around and everyone looks at it."
"OR";"Working well so far! Make sure you update the drive Magician software to the latestt version."
"OR";"Great story line. Jet Li played an excellent role. Full of action and comedy."
"OR";"these are very nice used in sons wedding as table decor this turned out nice gems are as described perfect"
"OR";"These are great, cheap sunglasses for cycling. They fit well with good wrap-around coverage. Rubber grips on the earpieces keep them firmly in place whether on my head or stuck into my helmet. The fact that they are so cheap means I don't care if they get damaged or lost (so far not yet!)."
"OR";"Cheap quality kit, but great for the price.  It does the job when you aren't a professional doing many many terminations."
"OR";"This is a very nice looking shoe if it fits correctly.  I have a normal sized ankle and calf.  The top strap is wide but flattering and also a tinge on the shorter side.  I am wearing on the last hole so that it is not tight and uncomfortable.  I will most likely go down a notch once a little stretc"
"OR";"I must admit to grinding it up for my dog, but he seems to like it, the price is right and it appears to be keeping him healthy."
"OR";"My daughter is loving this set. The wood pieces are made well. They're a bit smaller than I expected from the photo, but it's great there are so many different pieces for her to create castles in all sorts of configurations. I got this along with a set of magiclip princess figures so she builds cast"
"OR";"I replaced the caps on my Camelback Podium bottles (they're real bacteria gardens) with these.  They haven't leaked a drop."
"OR";"These were easy to install and sounded great. I love the sound that these speakers give out. I will be buying more of them for my other vehicles in the future."
"OR";"Very tiny and works very well. Comes with a battery. Has an attachment to put it on a key ring..Very cute and useful."
"OR";"I am very happy with quality of this product. It is huge and perfect for a large puppy who slobbers whenever he gets a drink."
"OR";"Holds gun securely, but still easy to draw. A good holster. Worth the modest price."
"OR";"Got this one as a replacement for another model that arrived in no working condition and it works great."
"OR";"My little girl (age 6) wanted this for Christmas & I am really glad I bought it for her. She uses this all the time!"
"OR";"I have been using the Centon Electronics Flash Memory Card (S1-SDXU1-64G) for the past few weeks in my Samsung digital camera and also my Sony digital videocamera. This high-performance SD card, with an impressive 64GB of storage, doubled the capacity of my previous SD cards. While not an issue with"
"OR";"My grandson absolutely loved the set, it has so many different tools.  He especially liked the squirt bottle."
"OR";"Great value for money. Does the job for those cold winter commutes. I would definately reccomend this product"
"OR";"After making some necessary alterations, the harness worked great.  Strap coming up between hind legs NOT NECESSARY."

"OR";"My dog always eat this food.
It's much cheaper price here that anywhere else and no carrying!
Love it!!!"

"OR";"This was a great story.  I enjoyed it very much  and look forward to reading  her other books.  I highly recommend it."
"OR";"I am so very happy to have this sign! I like the thick wood and excellent lettering. Of course, I absolutely love the little black Chihuahua! My ""Mojito"" was solid black. I already have one friend who always stands at the door without knocking, so she is gonna just love this sign when she sees it."
"OR";"These forks were just what I've needed to supplement the seafood tools I already had.  I am a lobster lover and will not waste a single morsel of the little claws.  These help me get it all.  In addition, I find these are really helpful for getting olives or pickles out of their jars.  They are grea"
"OR";"I wasn't too impressed with the quality and functionality of this book, so I returned it and have one made through a lady from etsy instead :)"
"OR";"Just received today--another great one from Ina. My wife has many of these books. Each has go-to recipes, and this is no exception."
"OR";"Here's a film where Seagal doesn't just go through those regular paces we all love him for, which is probably why most of the viewers reviewing this film here are disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautifu"
"OR";"Excellent transfer.  The 3D is seamless and not overdone.  There were a few ""wow"" moments.  The surround sound was also subtle but effective."
"OR";"good leader to train our dog to walk w/ us. He does not love it, but it is gentle and helps teach."
"OR";"This will be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter, but I haven't opened it up, but it looks like it does a lot of different things and she will enjoy it"
"OR";"Purchased for docking home pizzas, but also had in mind to use for docking convential pie dough.

This item works fine, but its considerably larger than expected making it difficult for use on just about anything except a large pizza. The size makes it a little difficult to store."
"OR";"These glasses make me happy. They are heavy and beautiful. They say not to put them in the dishwasher, but I do and they are fairing v. well."
"OR";"I know I`m going to have to tear out all the tile in 1 shower and replace it. It`s not fun so this buys me some time."
"OR";"This is a very nice story which made me think of how a commoner could conquer the heart of a Royal. The book is well written and states details of a dinner ceremony, which reminds me of a scene in Beauty and the Beast. Not that it is the same, but we can see that royal dinners all are alike! I look "
"OR";"I love this because it does't leak AT ALL. It's easy to clean in the dishwasher, the straw pops out easily and is easy to replace."
"OR";"I have had an eye on this movie for a long time. I watched it one night on Amazon Prime, and liked it so much that I just had to but it."
"OR";"Believe the hype.  Super easy to cut and install.  Be sure to choose a layout that looks great."
"OR";"Good simple watch for the price. Not a smart smart watch or a suunto but a good very day beater."
"OR";"This is my second cover from this seller.  I love that it is durable, functional and stylish.  I have recommended this product to several friends and bought one as a gift.  The case is easy to clean and the color is perfect.  Great seller, fast shipping and excellent price.  You really can't go wron"
"OR";"A happy customer in Hawaii!  I bought these for my son's preschool for their science table.  The kids really enjoyed it."
"OR";"Excellent antenna for my Cambridge Soundworks am/fm radio. Inexpensive and does the job. Fast shipping with prime from Amazon."
"OR";"Good price point and some nice color options.  Use to change the colors on the front of the house as the seasons change.  Green for St. Patrick's Day, Red for Valentines Day etc.  And being LED not so bad on the electric bill.  First one lasted me a few years."
"OR";"I enjoyed reading this book because it was easy to understand and the information was good. It gave helpful tips and tricks."
"OR";"Bought this a while ago. Sorry for the late review. This is a great flask. Keeps it ice cold all day."
"OR";"5 year Grandson loved it - very easy to assembly and painting was fun - he was creative and will have a birdhouse to enjoy after"
"OR";"I bought the replacement mat as my old one had rotted from sun damage. I have never replaced a mat before and was a little worried. But no need to worry. It fit perfect for my 12' trampoline bought from Walmart a few years back, and worked great. Not too hard and not too soft. Perfect. I highly reco"

"OR";"I am having a little problem with my pet. She has to use it. She is still trying to jump up into the truck. My husband and l thank you."
"OR";"I highly recommend Hooked! It's not your typical romance.  It's well written and gets you sucked in from the first page!"
"OR";"Really impressed with how nice this set is. Not as nice as some other name brands but for the price I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again."
"OR";"Love these sheets!  This makes my 2nd purchase.  Soft, wrinkle free, and keeps me cooler at night!"
"OR";"These look great on, and they survive through several rounds of beach volleyball and swimming in the ocean! Great sunnies!"
"OR";"I've read many other books in this series, but never this one until now.  It was as good as I had hoped it would be."
"OR";"This is one of those stories that you just sink into. The characters and scenes come alive and resonate, carrying you away to Ireland!"
"OR";"I bought this for my 40 lb dog Cookie, but she wasn't the least bit interested because it was too hard for her.  I ended up giving it to my friend who has a pitbull named Bertha who is 75 lbs.  Bertha loves it & hasn't even put a dent in it... friend was so impressed, she'll be buying more for sure!"
"OR";"This set is so awesome!  The designs on the boards are like fine art!  Much more fun than video games!"
"OR";"Better than what came with my cabinet, but could be better still. For the price, I can't complain too much. Did what I needed it to do."
"OR";"ONLY reason why I read this was for a college class and I found it confusing even with some background given. I do not like nor do not recommended it."
"OR";"These are great for starting charcoal in the grill.  Burn long enough to get a good coal going."
"OR";"Using for year-round in landscaping lights.  Wish they were slightly more white than orange, but I still love them for my purpose."
"OR";"I can't believe how much kitties LOVE these springs!  Was a donation on a Wish List. And then I bought some for my cats."
"OR";"My 8 yr old granddaughter loves this set. She's very artistic and says it has everything she likes in it."
"OR";"Works relatively well although difficult to hold in my hand.  I would probably get the Zyliss if I were to do it over."
"OR";"Band Of Brothers is the most realistic depiction of the Amrican experience in WWII I have ever seen. Do not miss it, it is something to be savored!"
"OR";"My daughter can't get enough of the toys. So happy I picked this for her first valentines day present"
"OR";"I have had quite a history with wearing jeans - there was a phase when I could pass off as a bum, and then another phase when I could pass as a bloated stick figure - and sadly each of those phases (and others in between) have been immortalized in my family photographs.
When I opened the box for the"
"OR";"This keeps the garage tidy by keeping the bikes upright. But it doesn't fit bikes with disc brakes very well. Just a little more room, a dip in the bar, whatever, would have made these much better to not mess up my discs. Aside from that, assembly was easy, and it seems very sturdy and durable."
"OR";"When we got our new puppy, we were told ""she's a chewer"" and given some rawhide chews for her. Those did NOT work. Our vet suggested we try a Kong toy for her, because they're made to withstand even the most heavy chewers. When we first got it, our girl showed little interest...but I read online tha"
"OR";"This is one of Nora Roberts' best trilogies. If you haven't read it, DO IT NOW! The characters and story line are excellent"
"OR";"I love this and my 6 month old loves this bath. Only downfall is the outside of it starts to mold very quickly"
"OR";"dont know exactly how these are suppose to fit but I don't like them. You can feel the ends under the balls of your feet"
"OR";"Love this! My lab weighs about 45 pds and fits perfect. Also doesn't pull on his chest."
"OR";"Definitely have to shape these to your head. It is cute but its just so big. I had to fight with it just to get it to bend to fit my friend's head."
"OR";"Michael G. Thomas is a well known author when it comes to science fiction novels and it definitely shows. He did really well with the third installment of the Star Crusades: Mercenaries series, ""War of the Exiles"".

"OR";"Well, I gathered all my moth traps up at the end of the summer and looked in them to find the Safer (darn-it more expensive) traps had captured way more moths than the other brands.  Can't argue there.  I do wonder though, why the pheromone thing has been made even smaller?? Still, I want to pay les"
"OR";"This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. You'll definetly lose sleep over this one Because you won't put it down!!!"

"OR";"Great brush!!!! amazing price compared to pet stores! works perfect for my Australian Shepard"
"OR";"RE Butler, need I say more.? I will though. I love the Wiccan- were-bear series. The imagination the author brings to life is such that you can immerse yourself in her world.

"OR";"This was a two day project to put together.  We stopped the first night after an hour or so when we saw how slow it was going to come together.  My husband had to make holes larger in the metal parts in certain places because it wouldn't go together otherwise.  We sweated it out, and it was a pretty"

Sixth grade curriculum  my students will love it!"
"OR";"Works well so far. You can get a lot more food in here than I originally thought, so that's a major plus."
"OR";"This film tells the story of a brave young Polish girl and the near death experiences she has protecting the jew's she is hiding up in the attic. It is s great story of bravery.

However all said and done the acting is extremely bad, like sonething out of a 1950's film. Marrion Ross should have stay"

"OR";"They worked out well for my trek to Everest Base Camp

they will adjust well to anyones head/behind their ears"
"OR";"How do you tie up a 18 book series?! Van Draanen has done an outstanding job of taking us on a Sammitriffic adventure with our favorite teen sleuth, capturing the excitement, courage and romance of the series--as well as showing us that people can change and that love wins in the end."
"OR";"I got this ball for our over 100lb German Shepherd that's ball crazy and these Chuckit Balls last him so long that these are the only balls that we buy for him.

"OR";"We have a Toshiba phone system, This system works for the price however its hard to hear at times on the other end."
"OR";"Got my wife the Kindle FIRE for the holiday and she is the type of person that needs a case and she loves green.  This was the only green case I could find for the FIRE, but it has been absolutely awesome.  It is almost like a faux leather and she loves it.  More importantly, it has kept her Kindle "
"OR";"I have a 7 month old kitten, three 6 year olds and one 16 year old cat. My 6 year old Tortie figured this feeder out instantly.

"OR";"I'm just learning to golf and chipping was not happening for me.  This club has actually made it a lot easier.  I love it."

"OR";"This little tree adds extra holiday cheer to my living room in December. It comes with little gold ornaments and is pre-lit, so I just added some of my own decorations to finish the piece.

"OR";"Bought two for my new double stainless steel sink. They look great and are totally functional."
"OR";"For what I paid $16 it was totally worth it. In fact, if you HAVE to pay retail, this is probably the most rugged wedge pack for the price. It holds a lot more than one might think and it sits tight underneath the seat without any hanging or interference with the back tire at all. I would buy again "
"OR";"I have loved this book since I was a child. I've read it multiple times and will probably read it again."
"OR";"My 4-year-old and nearly 2-year-old both love this toy! My 4-year-old loves to make the different bunny houses according to the pictures in the book.

"OR";"This is an awesome movie for kids.  It is so funny but has a great message...I highly recommend this for family time."

"OR";"Excellent lamps for camping, use for closets with bad lighting etc. light weight but sturdy."
"OR";"I was looking forward to working out in these to see how much I loved them and when I got home I realized I didn't even notice them! (I do crossfit) They're so light and fit so well, I absolutely love them, it's like I'm not wearing shoes. They're light and don't dig or fit funny anywhere."
"OR";"I love this series.  Each book gets better and better.  I can't wait for the next book."
